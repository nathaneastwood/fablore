# Azuro Keys

Picturesque lagoons, white-sand beaches, and waters so clear and warm that they seem to court the sky. Azuro Keys looks like the ultimate honeymoon getaway until a careless carouser notices the littered bones, bleached to a shine by the hard sun. The many longboats and pinnaces jut out of the water like wooden skeletons. They are a sobering reminder of mortal mishaps and scores settled by generations of pirates.

Larger ships are unable to enter the atoll, making naval battles impossible. As a result, it has become a neutral ground, used by pirates of all renown and quality to resolve personal feuds and hide the occasional plunder from prying eyes.

A few piscators, together with reclusive sailors, have built makeshift cabins and even small settlements along the coast. They sometimes encounter treasure-seekers, though most leave empty-handed. Those who stay either have a case of resilient greed or weren't after gold to begin with. Those canny few know the real treasure of the Keys is the simple life: feet in the soothing water, sun warming the skin, and the finest fishing in the High Seas.
