# High Seas

Far from the continent of [Rathe](../rathe/rathe.md), the High Seas beckons the seaworthy and skyworthy. Vast and unpredictable, the waters and islands here offer peril aplenty for even the sturdiest of ships and crew.

The cultures here were built upon the ruins of a long-dead Dhani Empire. Adepts of aether, the Dhani civilization was as wondrous as Rathe during the height of its Third Age. However, the Dhani grew too ambitious and destroyed their own empire in a quick succession of arcane calamities.

Nowadays, only the bravest seafarers sail the wild straits and causeways of the High Seas in search of lost treasure and renown. While settlements do flourish, both indigenous and imported, the lone sea and sky wolves remain fiercely independent. A captain's ship is their home and their crew is their kin. A pirate's goal is to find and steal enough loot to sustain their freebooting lifestyle, and for buccaneers bold and true, the future is golden.

# The Long Lost Empire

## The Dhani Empire

Only ruins and artifacts, monsters and arcane anomalies, now remain of the Dhani culture. The descendants of the few survivors have forgotten most of their heritage.

The empire was built upon the arcane arts, the manipulation of aether enabling the creation of potent relics and breathtaking monuments. The ruling class formed a matriarchal aethocracy, overseen by an arcane empress.

Yet aether was to be their making and their destruction. The last empress grew too powerful, and far too ambitious. She unleashed arcane forces that not even her greatest wizard could control, nor contain. Some cities sank into the ocean. Others were wiped out by a necrophage that slaughtered the fortunate and raised the cursed up as revenants and walking corpses. In some rare places, unimaginable powers ripped reality itself asunder.

## Tr≈çpal-Dhani

Legend has it that one city survived the Dhani apocalypse, and that it retains the wealth and aetheric glory that the empire once possessed. If it truly exists, no one from the High Seas has yet found it. The only clues to its whereabouts lie in the most dangerous ruins of its former empire.
