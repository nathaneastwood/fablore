# Teramundr's Triangle

Dusty tomes tell of a great war that ravaged the High Seas. Hate ran deep and the waters ran red. Nowhere was the fighting fiercer than in the area that would become known as Teramundr's Triangle. Wrath drove even the wisest minds to madness, and such malicious powers were unleashed that reality itself writhed in agony. Like a sail rent by too sharp a wind, the very fabric of the world was torn apart, never to be mended.

What happened next none can say, for neither time nor space has ever been quite the same around the Triangle. These days Teramundr's Triangle is a wound in the world, a watery grave for sanity, and a maelstrom of madness. Overlong appendages of abyssal terrors thrash among vast ship cemeteries that seemingly flicker in and out of existence, all while terrible storms alternate between freezing time and hastening its passage.

Impassable to traverse and impossible to avoid, the Triangle sits at the center of the High Seas, its three horns stabbing at the relative normalcy that surrounds it. To call it dangerous would be an understatement for the ages. Yet, the appeal is clear as stars for every pirate to see. Beyond the hoards of unclaimed treasure, Teramundr's Triangle is not just a breeding ground for terrible monsters but terrific stories as well, and that is one thing in constant demand.

## Teramundr's Brood

In hadal zones beyond name or measure, primordial leviathans of tectonic might stir in restless sleep, an age passing with their every yawn. They are spoken of in tales and taverns. Yet such accounts are flawed, for mere words cannot hope to describe or contain the eldritch enormity of these colossi.

Even so, the mega-krakens, multi-hydras, and other residents of the Triangle are often known as Teramundr's Brood. They were all born within the borders of the Triangle, for surely no other place on the High Seas could breed such carnivorous behemoths.

The amateur biomancers of Piper's Pier speculate the ancient Dhani played a role in their creation, a theory contradicted by the notable Swiller Saltbeard, who argues that the legendary war of the Triangle was fought not by humans, but by great tribes of prehistoric leviathans.

Whatever their true origin, the danger posed by Teramundr's Brood remains the same. It is a small mercy that not even the most foolhardy explorer could hope to venture deep enough to witness the full scale of these dread sea beasts.

## A Tear in Reality

Teramundr's Triangle stands as a warning to all who sail the High Seas. But to the few who dare study its origins, it imparts a dire lesson as well: that reality isn't fixed, but can be bent, bowed, and broken.

The ancient Dhani may well have been privy to this wisdom, even if their actions ultimately did not align with it. Likewise, the Triangle itself is no mere cartographic convenience, but an expression of formidable arcane potential.

Even to this day the air around Teramundr's Triangle is thick with aetheric echoes. However deadly and unstable, the area beckons not only the greedy and the gold-hungry, but also the introspective and the visionary. Strange, mayhap, that on the surface of Teramundr's restless sea, travelers see past and future versions of themselves, their lives threatened by dangers and changed by its mysteries.
