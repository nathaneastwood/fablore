# Among the Mists

The steep landscape of Misteria is equal parts treacherous and tranquil. The sun streams through the clouds, illuminating the mists in shades of white and gold, revealing the patches of greenery clinging to the steep rock face. Anyone not born within Misteria would struggle to survive in such an inhospitable environment, where one wrong step can send you plummeting down to the sharp rocks far below.

The villages of Misteria are built in some of the most inaccessible areas in Rathe, and those who live here must rely on their strength and agility to travel amongst the mountains. Racing along suspended ropes, scaling cliffs, and jumping across platforms are all second nature for the people of Misteria, who have built their lives around the unique environment.

A persistent layer of mist blankets villages across Misteria, broken only by beams of sunlight streaming through the clouds. At the break of dawn, the village stirs, as Misterians rise to begin their daily tasks. Farmers begin to tend to the hanging gardens, caring for plots of rice and vegetables. Others journey down to the waters below, laying out their nets to catch fish for the morning markets. Inns open their doors to the morning air, teahouses begin to make their food for the day, and students make their way to the dojo for training.

The people of Misteria value hard work and dedication, traits necessary to survive in the unforgiving landscape that they call home.

### Rite of Passing
According to legend, the Rite of Passing is held on the one day of the year when the veil between worlds is thinnest, and the world of spirits is closest to the world of the living. The Rite honours the dead by welcoming the spirits home and inviting them to take part in the celebrations.

When night falls, all Misterians don an ornate ceremonial mask that hides their face from view and makes the living indistinguishable from the dead. Lanterns are lit and raised into the sky, floating among the stars, illuminating the dancers below. The celebrations last through the night, and do not end until dawn, when the spirits return to the realm of the dead.

### Mistcloak Gully
The ancestral home of the House of Sanjing, Mistcloak Gully is a sprawling collection of steep cliffs surrounding a natural lake. The waterfalls within the gully produce a thick blanket of mist, which obscures many of the buildings that lie deep within. Far below, a fast-moving stream travels through the gully, the sound of rushing water echoing up the stone walls.
