    <td><strong>Miharu</strong><br>This house creates some of the best armour in Misteria, formed from leather and toughened cloth. Flexible enough for hand-to-hand combat, yet tough enough to defend against attacks from a sharp weapon, the Miharu house provides armour for some of the largest houses in Misteria.</td>

    <td><strong>Yijun</strong><br>A house that prides themselves on their weaving, members of the Yijun house create some of the most remarkable items of clothing imaginable. Many people of Misteria purchase items for festivals and celebrations from the Yijun house. Fabric woven by members of the Yijun house can resemble anything from the shimmering ripples of a slow-moving stream, to the gentle glitter of sunlight streaming through the mists.</td>

    <td><strong>Ishigaki</strong><br>The village surrounding Mistcloak Gully exists, in part, due to the talent and skill found within the Ishigaki house. The work of stonemasons from this house is incomparable, as in carving buildings into the surrounding cliffs, they utilise the stone itself to prevent water damage and structural problems.</td>
