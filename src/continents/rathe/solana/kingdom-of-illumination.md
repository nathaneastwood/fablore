# Kingdom of Illumination

The city of Solana stands tall amidst the golden fields, at the very heart of Rathe; it is a radiant beacon for all to follow. Its soaring stone walls glitter in the light of the sun as it watches over its outlying villages like a stalwart guardian. It shepherds its charges along the path of the Light. Through its grand gates lie shining city streets, lined with banners of white and gold.

Once a small settlement, the city of Solana has grown throughout the centuries, providing a place of sanctuary to all who follow the Light. Benevolent scholars smile upon the crowds, providing enlightenment, guidance and counsel, while noble knights patrol the city walls and fields beyond, protecting the innocent with sword and shield. Together, they work to protect and provide for their people, dedicating their lives to upholding the word of Sol.

All are welcomed within Solana, whether inside the city proper, or in the villages which lie beyond its walls. The citizens of Solana honour Sol in every aspect of their lives; they carry the glory and wisdom of the Light within their hearts as they seek to guide all of Rathe into a golden age, where all will be free of pain and suffering.

## History of Illumination
Legends speak of blessed pilgrims from a distant land, drawn to Rathe by the will of Sol. Upon sacred ground, they built the small village that would one day bloom into a paragon of virtue and enlightenment. Under the careful guidance of the first Grand Magister, the great city of Solana blossomed, growing ever larger in scale and in stature.

In time, its radiance drew attention from a malevolent gaze, and the fledgling city found itself targeted by the onslaught of the Shadow, a great evil which spread forth, intent on extinguishing the Light. Despite this sinister force, which threatened to overwhelm them, the Solanians stood strong; fortified by their faith, they refused to bow before the foul storm.
