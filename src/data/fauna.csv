Name|Description
[Vitr'eo](../world-of-rathe/aria/creatures.md#vitreo)|A majestic creature with a thick mane, crowned with a series of large crystals that grow out from the top of its skull. In addition to its dense coat, it grows large tusks on either side of its jaw.
[Kai'eo](../world-of-rathe/aria/creatures.md#kaieo)|These shy, reclusive mammals are notable for their luxurious fur. Their bodies are long and thin, with short legs and a narrow head. Their long, white fur is incredibly soft, keeping them warm in winter and cool during the summer. They shed their coats each spring along with the uppermost layer of their hide, and will grow a new coat of fur within a few days. These discarded coats are often used in clothing across Aria.
[Na'shari](../world-of-rathe/aria/creatures.md#nashari)|A large beast with a crystalline hide, the na'shari has skin harder than most forms of metal. In spite of its tough appearance, this creature is known for its docile and friendly nature. Its round eyes and fuzzy tail make the creature incredibly popular with children, who often flock to na'shari in hopes of playing with the creature.
[Meep](../world-of-rathe/aria/creatures.md#meep)|These tiny, mischievous creatures are recognised by their long limbs and tails, and colourful feather crests. Meeps are usually found in the vicinity of the Everfest Carnival, travelling along with the Carnival and stealing food and shiny objects from its patrons.
[Fianna](../world-of-rathe/aria/creatures.md#fianna)|These majestic creatures are tall, with long flowing tails, tough skin, and massive antlers crowning the top of their head. Fianna are often used by the Everfest Carnival for their strength and placid nature, helping to move the Carnival's many attractions from location to location.
[Vuurlin](../world-of-rathe/volcor/wildlife.md#vuurlin)|A large bird of prey that flies at a high altitude, only descending to roost or to attack vulnerable prey. When in flight, the tips of their feathers catch alight, creating flames that streak behind them as they soar through the sky. They're reliable messengers, and are often used by the royal court and the many generals of Volcor, due to the vuurlin's keen intelligence and powerful wings.
[Longma](../world-of-rathe/volcor/wildlife.md#longma)|Despite their vague resemblance, longma are larger than the mounts used by Solana, ink-black in colour and covered in a dense coat of fur that helps to protect them from embers. Longma store heat within their bodies as a source of energy, smoke escaping their nostrils with every exhale. These hardy creatures are excellent for long-distance travel, able to withstand the heat of Volcor's landscape.
[Ryoki](../world-of-rathe/volcor/wildlife.md#ryoki)|These are small creatures, similar in appearance to fish, that inhabit the lava streams and rivers of Volcor. Despite the immense heat, these creatures thrive in the extreme conditions, lurking beneath the glowing surface of the magma. While their scales are almost black, their 'fins' catch alight when they break the surface of the lava, leaping from stream to stream.
[Morrows](../world-of-rathe/volcor/wildlife.md#morrows)|These tiny wisps are artificially created by the wizards of Volcor; puffs of smoke brought to life by a breath of aether. Once formed, they subsist entirely on embers, flitting to and fro amongst the fiery landscape.
[Apophis](../world-of-rathe/volcor/wildlife.md#apophis)|A large serpent with barbed scales, which can be found lurking within larger bodies of magma, storing energy and lying in wait. These creatures move with Volcor's lava flows, moving through the magma to feast on those caught in the flow's path. While they can occasionally be found on land, they move much more slowly, and are thus vulnerable to attack.
[Cesari](../world-of-rathe/aria/a-true-sanctuary.md#cesari)|Ethereal creatures borne of magic, fading in and out of existence based on the ebb and wane of the Flow. While they appear sentient, Cesari are mirages, mere echoes of ancient beings that once called Aria home. They appear as iridescent, semi-translucent phantoms, shimmering as they ripple through the air. Cesari can range in size from small, floating wisps that drift along with the breeze, to massive, twin-tailed creatures the size of comets, leaving streaks of vibrant light in their wake.
[Azeri](../digital-tiles/03-crucible-of-war/crucible-of-war.md#skullhorn)|The Azeri are elusive and mysterious, lingering in the innermost depths of the [Savage Lands](../world-of-rathe/savage-lands/savage-lands.md).
[Rek'vas](../world-of-rathe/savage-lands/bestiary-of-scarborough.md#rekvas)|A swift and deadly creature, the Rek'vas has brightly patterned scales that are highly toxic. Its massive head is framed by some form of hood, brightly coloured skin that flares from either side of its neck.
[Skera](../world-of-rathe/savage-lands/bestiary-of-scarborough.md#skera)|One of the Savage Lands' most skilled predators, they are almost completely nocturnal, relying on the darkness to help mask their movements while stalking prey. Their four eyes are likely to help it see in the dark, in order to hunt its prey. Avoid their poisonous spikes at all costs. The barb at the end of its tail is also highly toxic. Large, muscular creatures with two pairs of eyes, and long, curved claws similar to talons. Skera are covered in a mixture of fur and spikes, patterned with dark, irregular spots. While the spikes do not appear to be poisonous, they do make it rather difficult to dissect.
[Peluda](../world-of-rathe/savage-lands/bestiary-of-scarborough.md#peluda)|A large creature, the Peluda moves surprisingly quickly given its size, with a thick fur coat interspersed with sharp spikes. Its muscular legs are the source of its apparent speed. Its muscular tail is capable of sweeping any animal off of its feet, leaving it vulnerable to the peluda's deadly hooked claws. While the tail appears to have a stinger, further tests have shown that the barb does not contain any form of toxin.
[Ank'is](../world-of-rathe/savage-lands/bestiary-of-scarborough.md#ankis)|The crystalline creature does not bleed. It shatters. Its teeth are harder than stone, with serrated edges and a needle-like tip to tear through flesh. Its limbs are long and thin, with sharp points to allow it to grip onto most surfaces, and scale the difficult terrain of the Savage Lands.
[Brawnhide](../world-of-rathe/savage-lands/bestiary-of-scarborough.md#brawnhide)|A giant, furred beast with long, thick canines, and small, dark eyes. Its long fur protects most of its body, dark grey in colour, fading to an off-white at the tips. It appears to make up for its poor sight through its incredibly powerful sense of small - I have witnessed it track prey through the jungle by scent alone. Their canines are almost impossible to break, both thick and incredibly strong. The brawnhide has a set of claws at the base of their feet, though their feet are far too large and their legs too short for the claws to be of any use.
[Blindseal](../main-story/10-outsiders/its-just-business.md)|Blubbery
[Bloatfin](../main-story/10-outsiders/its-just-business.md)|
[Raciki](../main-story/15-part-the-mistveil/part-1-the-tiger-in-the-mist.md)|Shapeshifting, fluffy canine
[Rowbug](../main-story/15-part-the-mistveil/part-1-the-tiger-in-the-mist.md)|
[Scarbit](../short-stories/roll-of-honour/rhinar.md)|
[Desert Fox](../main-story/17-the-hunted/hunter-and-hunted-both.md)|The creature's mouth warped by two large boar-like tusks
[Flare Deer](../main-story/17-the-hunted/hunter-and-hunted-both.md)|Its scent glands swollen with massive oozing growths
