### Aurum Aegis

[Victor](../../heroes-of-rathe/victor-goldmane-about.md) scoffs at anything less than the pinnacle of armaments crafted by only the most elite smiths, his insatiable greed fuelled by bottomless wealth.<br>

### Hood Of Red Sand

Whispers echo through the desolate desert, borne on the wind, carrying tales of 'The Terror of the Golden Sands.' A scarlet blur, a fleeting glimpse of unbridled savagery, is often the last sight seared into the minds of those unfortunate enough to cross paths with this merciless fighter.

### Olympia Prized Fighter

"In this arena, victory is the air I breathe, the culmination of facing every challenge and etching my name in the echoes of the peoples' cheers for decades. As you stand on this battlefield, know that it is littered with a hundred remnants of my past victories. I will show you nothing but my best, and I expect nothing less from you."<br>

### Show No Mercy

The arena is no place for mercy. One slight pause in Demetrios' judgement, and [Rhinar](../../heroes-of-rathe/rhinar-about.md) seized the opportunity to show him the raw brutality that defines a winner from a loser.

### Up The Ante

"These grounds bear witness to the fallen, the bodies of those who dared to bet against me. Are you ready to raise the stakes, to gamble that victory will always be mine?"<br>
