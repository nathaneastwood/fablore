### Aether Bindings of the Third Age

During the War of the Old Ones, the Aetherscribes attuned their keen intellects to the eldritch forces that flow through the fabric of Rathe's reality. With engines esoteric, they drew upon the aether and animated their machinations of war.

### Aurora, Shooting Star

"The wonders of the Valahai, tucked away in the vaults of shattered [Enion](~Enion). It'd be a shame not to crack them open and take a peek. Dangerous? Sure! But you can't see around the next corner without sticking your neck out, right?" - [Aurora, Shooting Star](../../heroes-of-rathe/aurora-about.md#aurora-shooting-star)

### Blossoming Decay

"You have taught me much, my silent companions. From your passing I have learned the secrets of life. In your crumbling bones I see the beauty of transformation. The Rotwood speaks through you, its wisdom etched into the flowers upon your grave." - [Florian, Rotwood Harbinger](../../heroes-of-rathe/florian-about.md#florian-rotwood-harbinger)

### Earth's Embrace

Our [Rosetta](~Rosetta) languish like trees that have not borne fruit in centuries. They are mere buds dozing dormant in the endless summer. But the sweet scent of harvest now wafts through [Candlehold](../../regions/rathe/aria/the-land-of-legends.md#candlehold). To sticky-sweet hands the promise of abundance returns.

### Felling of the Crown

"Listen well, my loyal Rosetta. A sorrow lies buried within the roots of our ancient home, a choice made in a time of war. But within this forest lies the power to mend it. The path may be overgrown, yet the way is clear for those who seek with open hearts." - The Queen of Candlehold

### Fertile Ground

Those that fought by [Davnir](~Davnir)'s side now imbue the land with their gentle protection. Faces in the foliage smile warmly upon the Rosetta, and the limbs of trees bow gracefully to guide their people home. The fallen ensure that all who seek solace in the forest find their way.

### Florian, Rotwood Harbinger

"I am a child of autumn, banished from the eternal summer. Death follows my every spoiling footstep, decaying at a touch. Am I cursed? No. The Rotwood is forever changing and I behold its beauty anew every day." - Florian, Rotwood Harbinger

### Germinate

Embody now the essence of this place,<br>
Where life and death in endless dance entwine.<br>
Bear forth the power, wisdom and grace,<br>
Of Rotwood's will, its purpose now thine.

### Harvest Season

"Florian may find solace in the silence of the past, but I find joy in the vibrancy of the present. There is much that death can teach us, but it is through life that we find true strength. Through time alone, we achieve true wisdom." - [Verdance, Thorn of the Rose](../../heroes-of-rathe/verdance-about.md#verdance-thorn-of-the-rose)

### Heartbeat of Candlehold

Plucking heart from the heartless, the Queen claimed the future of her people as great Davnir passed from manifest to metaphor. The forest, thus sealed from time's depravations, became a haven beyond history, its roots gripping to an ageless crime.

### Oscilio, Constella Intelligence

Gathering the finest Aetherscribes, the Valahai embarked on their greatest creation. Each mind contributed a fragment of their essence to the forging. This process, both arduous and delicate, amalgamated the epitome of arcanity and golemetry. It was a labor of ambition and desperation, rendering their knowledge incarnate.

### Rotwood Reaper

Florian plunged a lifeless branch into the mephitic altar and drew forth an embodiment of pure decay. He asked none for permission, gave no apology, for alone he would command the putrefying power of Rotwood.

### Sanctuary of Aria

"In [Aria](../../regions/rathe/aria/aria.md), every step is a journey through a living song; every breath taken is a draft of pure music. It is a land where nature and enchantment are harmonized; a sanctuary for all who seek the wonder of waking dreams." - [Melody, Sing-along](../../heroes-of-rathe/melody-about.md)

### Seeds of Tomorrow

As summer gave way to autumn, Candlehold bathed in scarlet and amber. The Queen's parting wisdom lingered in the cooling air. A millennia of peace, yet what price would be paid for perpetuity? Entrusted unto the hands of her Rosetta, it was more than a mere seed. It was a choice.

### Sigil of Brilliance

The Aetherscribes, foreseeing a time when their presence would no longer grace the world, sought to ensure their knowledge and power would endure. This sigil stands as a monument to their foresight, preserving their accomplishments for ages to come.

### Sigil of Deadwood

A place where life and decay embrace; where the cycle of death feeds fresh growth. We are but fragments of the whole - drops of the sap that courses through Rotwood. For every sprout there is a story told anew.

### Staff of Verdant Shoots

From a tiny seed, our lady Verdance nurtured a sapling of fecund potential. Flourish it did, the staff blossoming into an instrument of restoration and protection. And under Verdance's safe keeping - a symbol of the unyielding vitality of Candlehold.

### Star Fall

From cosmic remnants scattered amongst scarred mountain tops, the Aetherscribes harvested iron meteoric. With the smiths of Anvilheim they built forges of lightning, crafting weapons that might one day evoke the very spirit of [Yvor](~Yvor).

### Verdance, Thorn of the Rose

"Our home is not something that I will sit by and watch wither. I am tasked with preserving this enduring summer and will safeguard against those who would see autumn creep into these lands. Even the brightest flowers have thorns." - Verdance, Thorn of the Rose

### Volzar, Lightning Rod

Lightning bound through aetheric channels, its violent longings held resolute. In the spirit of Yvor, the Aetherscribes tethered the storms of Enion, only to be unleashed in times of dire necessity by the allies of besieged Valahai.
