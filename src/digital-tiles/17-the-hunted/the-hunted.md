### Dragonscaler Flight Path

Some of the [Emperor](../../heroes-of-rathe/emperor-about.md)'s most trusted servants see in his murder an opportunity for glory. To them, there is no greater sign of devotion than to hunt his enemies, no grander display of honor than to exact vengeance with fire, again and again, until the dynasty is reborn.

### Fire and Brimstone

"Deshvahan, vile den of traitors and usurpers, I sentence you to the flames! Let those who plot against the dragon burn with you, and all who conspire against our dynasty perish in the fires! You shall burn to the ground, a meager pyre for our mighty Emperor!" - [Taipanis](../../heroes-of-rathe/other.md#taipanis-dracai-of-judgement)

### Kabuto of Imperial Authority

This imposing helm, worn solely by the officers of the royal hosts, has been a symbol of fealty since the time of the first emperors. Those who don it now do so with a renewed vow: To hunt down the enemies of the dynasty and avenge their fallen liege.

### Mask of Deceit

"Every web is spun from just one thread. The first strike shapes the blade's point. Yet the perfect killer is not born from a single body trauma, but a lifetime of anguish, torture and a myriad of tiny cuts." - Doctor Krest Mortimer

### Oath of Loyalty

The loyalist forces are aided by powerful wizards of the imperial court, these nobles paving the way with torrents of fire and infernal conjurations. Though the [Dracai](~Dracai) lords of [Volcor](../../continents/rathe/volcor/volcor.md) are famously capricious, many swore fealty to the Emperor, considering him the mightiest mage of them all.

### Under the Trap-Door

Reality is not always as the Dracai presume. Aether contains a myriad of natures. Even in the heart of [Ashvahan](~Ashvahan), in the most sacred and secure chamber in Volcor, stones and fire may be told to part ways, to welcome the touch of chaos.

### Wrath of Retribution

[Cindra](../../heroes-of-rathe/cindra-about.md) rose above the anarchy surrounding her and harnessed the power of the [Sayashi](~Sayashi). Out they flew. Eight kunai to carve a fiery path of retribution across the obsidian chamber. Eight daggers to blind the creatures of corruption. Eight lacerations to make them see.
