### Chowder, Hearty Cook

Kraken ragout, kulpie terrine, sawmaw souffl√© - there was nary an ingredient [Gravy](../../heroes-of-rathe/gravy-about.md)'s chief cook couldn't turn into a hearty meal. Death may have changed the crew's appetites, but the chef's new Menu de Morbid is sure to satisfy.

### Dead Threads

Discovered among the possessions of the [Dhani](~DhaniEmpire) death-mage Thanuella, this grim relic casts doubt on the true nature and purpose of the necrophage. Was the curse of [Dreadfall Reach](../../regions/high-seas/dreadfall-reach/dreadfall-reach.md) no mistake? If its creators were prepared to resist it, then why were they undone by it?

### Jolly Bludger

Only the most demented, deranged, death-defying lunatic would ram one airship into another; a fact Captain Bludge exploits as he terrorizes the merchant zeppelins of Piper's Pier. Water, air, fire - the greatest element is always surprise.

### Kelpie, Tangled Mess

It ain't no easy job keeping equipment in order and a crew in line. The fact that everything on Gravy's ship is either undead, underwater, or both, don't help much. But Kelpie the boatswain ain't tying herself in knots about it. She knows the ropes, and ain't afraid to yank them when the need arises.

### Moray le Fay

A sea sibyl well-versed in the art of death, most pirates steered clear of Moray le Fay. But the ambitious Gravy Bones saw a chance to make a powerful ally, and when he rose from the depths, it was with Le Fay at his side.

### Scooba, Salty Sea Dog

In life, Scooba was an expert fetcher and a trusted lookout. Such devotion earned her a place at Gravy Bones' feet. Fortunately, death hasn't dulled her senses, only given her an insatiable craving for bones - much to the dismay of the rest of the crew.

### Swabbie

Swabbie spent his early years building Gravy Bones' dread vessel, and the rest overseeing its repairs. When the waves finally claimed the pirate king's ship, the shipwright swore a dire oath: to guard his masterpiece in death as he had in life.
