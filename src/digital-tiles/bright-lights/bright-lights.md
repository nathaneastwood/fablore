### Fabricate

Node connects to node with circuits dynamic. Forming patterns. Forming pictures. Billions of ones and zeros, meeting and making in a mindscape of automation. A tallic for your thoughts, little one. - Jules Teklovossen

### Hyper Scrapper

Out with the old and in with the new. The skyline of Metrix isn't a static image. It's no painting to hang on the wall. It's a live show, a dynamic animation. Change is the only constant in the city of progress, wonder, and light.

### Meganetic Lockwave

In Metrix, an immaculate amalgam of minerals and metals forms the foundation for the technology you see. Gravity, electromagnetism, the dance of force and form. Energy, matter and mass-opposites meeting in beautiful collisions, driving the future forward.

### Moonshot

Forget a grand entrance. Go for the destructive departure. The explosive exit. See me blast outta eighth and past [Lowlake](../../world-of-rathe/metrix/a-sprawling-metropolis.md#lowlake) with the nitro on full throttle. I may not know where I'm going, but you'll definitely know where I've been. Just look up! Watch for Powder Kegs in the moonlight.

### Steel Street Enforcement

Without law and order, there can be no peace, no prosperity. The [Iron Assembly](../../world-of-rathe/metrix/a-better-tomorrow.md#iron-assembly) safeguards the wellbeing of every citizen in Metrix. Security ensures stability. Therefore, unstable elements must be realigned. Do we make
ourselves clear? - Steelstreet Enforcers
