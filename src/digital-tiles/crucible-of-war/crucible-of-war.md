"...it comes from beyond, a conduit for something far older. This is the price of true power - an equivalent exchange, and the cost not always known; not until it is far too late to change your fate. There must always be a source, whether from some order being, or from the artefacts that they left behind. The Arknight shard is, of course..." - excerpt from Lord Sutcliffe's personal research
