The forest of Candlehold is older than Aria itself. Its tranquil woods are Evergreen, for the Queens magic has rendered them eternal.

### Tear Asunder

Legends tell of [Guardians](../../world-of-rathe/aria/tides-of-change.md#legend-of-the-guardians) that tore open the heavens with their bare hands. Exaggeration? Maybe. But it's no question that the Guardians were as deadly as they come, and protected humanity in the early Ages.
