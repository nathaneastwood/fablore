For services unto the loyal citizens of this glorious land, our Mighty [Emperor](../heroes-of-rathe/emperor-about.md), the Dracai of Aesir, bestows upon you this relic of war. May you display it boldly as a symbol of your continued devotion to the royal bloodline of [Volcor](../continents/rathe/volcor/volcor.md).

This delicate headdress was captured by our courageous [Dracai](~Dracai) during a disquieting incident at our Western border. The tiara's exact history died to our manic incoherence. Those Dracai who survived the encounter were much traumatized by the ordeal. It has taken some of them years to recover their fortitude. In light of their trials, and in the name of the empire, the Amethyst Tiara is a reminder to us all that the loyal road can be arduous, yet all the more rewarding for it.

A formal endowment ceremony shall take place in the Imperial Palace on the eve of our esteemed Dragon Festival, where his Most Excellent Majesty shall entrust this relic to you in perpetuity.

Dracai of Ceremonies by will of the Emperor of Volcor
