For services unto the loyal citizens of this glorious land, our Mighty [Emperor](../heroes-of-rathe/emperor-about.md), the Dracai of Aesir, bestows upon you this relic of war. May you display it boldly as a symbol of your continued devotion to the royal bloodline of [Volcor](../world-of-rathe/volcor/volcor.md).

Fashioned after the Forest of Flames, the Blazen Yoroi was plucked by our brave soldiers from a nest of rebellious vipers. It is to be worn as a trophy of triumph, a mantle that shoulders the weighty burdens of law and order. As dynasties new and old maintain, gratitude is not instinctual. Loyalty is not a birthright. By force of will and firmness of hand, the Emperor teaches his people to serve. And in service, we are all armoured in greatness.

A formal endowment ceremony shall take place in the Imperial Palace on the eve of our esteemed Dragon Festival, where his Most Excellent Majesty shall entrust this relic to you in perpetuity.

Dracai of Ceremonies by will of the Emperor of Volcor
