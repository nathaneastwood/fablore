Dark magic always has a price. Deep within the shadows, spilled blood forms the roots for forbidden spellwork, aether sacrificed for raw power. Runes flaring in the darkness, armour forged from skin and bone; a parasite which will eventually take his life. With time, the pain dulls... skin turning to stone, aether flowing beneath the surface like magma beneath a volcano. The final piece, completing a project years in the making - but was it worth it?
