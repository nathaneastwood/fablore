# Comeback Kicks

They are the Sandlars of the Moat, a clan of craftsfolk who set their awls to leather the week Deathmatch opened its first fighting pits. Grannie Sandlar learned to cut soles from beast-hides still warm from the desert sun, tanning them in the salt lakes for rugged hardiness. The Sandlars pattern each pair to the gladiator's gait, stitching tactics into the straps, and swear with sure odds that every pair will outlast the wearer.
