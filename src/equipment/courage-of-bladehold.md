The knight's new armour gleams as bright as the noonday sun, crimson cloak billowing behind her as she kneels before the crowds. At the very centre of the amphitheatre, she is resplendent, head bowed, golden hair billowing in the breeze. While her shoulders bow under some unspoken pressure, her gaze flicks to an older warrior standing nearby, and her expression brightens, filled with clear purpose. As she begins to recite her oaths, her firm voice cuts through the hushed quiet of the crowds, laced with unwavering determination.
