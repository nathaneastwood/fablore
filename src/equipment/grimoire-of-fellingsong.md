# Grimoire Of Fellingsong

A grimoire is written in rites and bound in secrets. Old as the [Demonastery](../world-of-rathe/demonastery/demonastery.md)'s blood-drenched mortar, each invocation of suffering nests another rune in its thirsting vellum. This Fellingsong shivers at [Vynnset](../heroes-of-rathe/vynnset-about.md)'s touch, sigils rising like braille for her to cast a darker vision into the world, all while [Nasreth](~Nasreth) whispers at the turn of the page, and the Shadow takes another breath.
