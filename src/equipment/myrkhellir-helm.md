# Myrkhellir Helm

Beneath the ravaged surface, behind lava‑forged gates, the dwarven bastion of Myrkhellir armed the brave who fought against the Old Ones. In caverns that rang with pick and drill, forges roared, as master smiths tempered dwarven steel with oathfire. From their toil came this helm, gold-plated and mountain‑true. Don it, feel the weight upon your brow, fortifying your resolve when lesser wills falter.
