For services unto the loyal citizens of this glorious land, our Mighty [Emperor](../heroes-of-rathe/emperor-about.md), the Dracai of Aesir, bestows upon you this relic of war. May you display it boldly as a symbol of your continued devotion to the royal bloodline of [Volcor](../world-of-rathe/volcor/volcor.md).

Borne by General Umadesu, this shield represents the empire's fearless purity in the face of corruption. Umadesu stood against sinister forces that sought to usurp our southern lands. He fought and died in the throes of duty, all to safeguard his beloved people. Our citizens may live in immaculate peace thanks to Umadesu's ultimate sacrifice. The honour of his noble service is now your to uphold.

A formal endowment ceremony shall take place in the Imperial Palace on the eve of our esteemed Dragon Festival, where his Most Excellent Majesty shall entrust this relic to you in perpetuity.

Dracai of Ceremonies by will of the Emperor of Volcor
