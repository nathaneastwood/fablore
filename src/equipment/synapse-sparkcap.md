# Synapse Sparkcap

Mention [Cogmire's Salvage Emporium](../world-of-rathe/metrix/a-sprawling-metropolis.md#cogmires-salvage-emporium-and-workshoppe) and every Mechanologist's eyes light up. In that yard, many, [Jules Teklovossen](../heroes-of-rathe/teklovossen-about.md) among them, scavenged the parts that sparked their first (and sometimes final) creations. For Jules, it turned his pondering genius to his first Evo. This adaptive helm syncs wetware to hardware through a 'safe' neural latticework. Don it and feel his visionary future excite your imagination beyond mortal limits.
