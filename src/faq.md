## Characters
### Is Ira dead?

We don't know. [Her story](main-story/03-crucible-of-war/edge-of-autumn.md) takes place hundreds of years before the current main story timeline, that's all we know. There is nothing written that outright states she is dead, however she is human...

### What do we know about Jackdaw?

Not much, he is mentioned in some flavour text such as [Pitfall Trap](flavour/03-crucible-of-war.md#pitfall-trap---cru127), [Out Muscle](flavour/04-monarch.md#out-muscle---mon248) and [Pay Day](flavour/09-dynasty.md#pay-day---dyn123). We also read about him in [A Bird in the Hand](main-story/02-arcane-rising/a-bird-in-the-hand.md) where he is standing outside [Blackjack's Tavern](world-of-rathe/pits/blackjacks-mercenary-group.md#blackjacks-mercenary-group).

> The ruler of the jungle deep, a predator without equal, is lost in slumber... yet its heart still beats, somewhere amongst the undergrowth, echoing the endless cycle of life and death."

### What do we know about Ophidia?

Not much beyond what is written on the [flavour text](flavour/02-arcane-rising.md#eye-of-ophidia---arc000).
