Arakni is the blade that strikes in the dead of night.

Having crawled out from the most wretched recesses of [The Pits](../world-of-rathe/pits/pits.md), Arakni has shed their past like a slurry scorpion sheds its carapace. A dagger unsheathed of morality and conscience, a weapon of sharpened mind and polished purpose.

Arakni cares nothing for the petty squabbles infecting the minds of [Rathe](../world-of-rathe/world-of-rathe.md)'s denizens, nor the sweaty dealings of contract and coin. The work is their life and their life is the work.

To the murderous wannabes straining for attention in Arakni's wake, their slayings are peerless. The most notorious include a captain of industry, fed to the cogs of his grinding machines, and an artist of deadly grace, lost to the reddened morning mists of her mountainous refuge. Yet the most astonishing of those witnessed or attributed remains the head of a primal warlord mounted amongst their own skullish trophies. Fatalities unnatural and inexplicable-to the uninitiated. Killings both admired and analyzed by their fellow dealers in death.

Like a stone dropped into a stygian pool, Arakni causes ripples they will never witness nor reflect. Arakni carries no malice for those they take, has no reason to dance upon any man's grave.

Death is Arakni's only concern. Assassination, their singular delight.

No-one escapes Southmaw. No-one except Patient 1413.

The feral orphan, taken and tormented to the point of no return. The silent prodigy transformed into an expression of graceful violence.

Having crawled out from the most wretched recesses of the Pits, and again from the test tube of teknocratic greed, Patient 1413 has shed their past like a slurry scorpion sheds its carapace.

No longer the lab rat for the Iconoclast Trials, subjected to the poisonous experiments of a mad scientist. No longer the puppet on Metrixian strings.

Serving the nest as Arakni and regarded throughout the Pits as the Huntsman, they care nothing for the petty squabbles infecting the minds of Rathe's denizens, nor the sweaty dealings of contract and coin. The work is their life and their life is the work.

Their instincts revived and rewired, they have become a weapon of sharpened mind and polished purpose, unsheathed of morality or conscience.

Like a stone dropped into a stygian pool, Arakni causes ripples they will never witness nor reflect. Arakni carries no malice for those they take, has no reason to dance upon any man's grave.

Death is Arakni's only concern. Assassination, their singular delight.

    <b>Stealth</b><br>

You are the spider, plucking at the threads, drawing your prey ever closer. You are at the center of the trap, weaving your plans. Yet you are not alone. The others are watching, waiting with fatal patience. They will take your place, when the time is ripe as the carved bone dice of chaos decides. For a conspiracy is made of many connections, of which you are but one. And all know that it takes an entire web to catch the fly.

Arakni, Marionette is a living creation of mortal design and intent. It is a masterwork of sculpted flesh and decanted blood, fashioned by hidden hands in secret places. It is more than a mere killer. It is the culmination of dangerous research and apocalyptic aspirations, of the finest minds driven into feverish inspiration.

This is a predator that stalks the top of the chain, the beautiful beast that hunts the hunters.
