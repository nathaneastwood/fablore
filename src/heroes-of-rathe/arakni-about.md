Arakni is the blade that strikes in the dead of night.

Having crawled out from the most wretched recesses of [The Pits](../regions/rathe/pits/pits.md), Arakni has shed their past like a slurry scorpion sheds its carapace. A dagger unsheathed of morality and conscience, a weapon of sharpened mind and polished purpose.

Arakni cares nothing for the petty squabbles infecting the minds of [Rathe](../regions/rathe/rathe.md)'s denizens, nor the sweaty dealings of contract and coin. The work is their life and their life is the work.

To the murderous wannabes straining for attention in Arakni's wake, their slayings are peerless. The most notorious include a captain of industry, fed to the cogs of his grinding machines, and an artist of deadly grace, lost to the reddened morning mists of her mountainous refuge. Yet the most astonishing of those witnessed or attributed remains the head of a primal warlord mounted amongst their own skullish trophies. Fatalities unnatural and inexplicable-to the uninitiated. Killings both admired and analyzed by their fellow dealers in death.

Like a stone dropped into a stygian pool, Arakni causes ripples they will never witness nor reflect. Arakni carries no malice for those they take, has no reason to dance upon any man's grave.

Death is Arakni's only concern. Assassination, their singular delight.

Southmaw Asylum is a laboratory of horrors where the orphaned and discarded of the Pits beneath [Metrix](../regions/rathe/metrix/metrix.md) are subjected to nightmarish experiments, but for Patient 1131 it was home.

No one remembers the person that entered Southmaw, soon rendered unrecognizable by the surgeries and tests conducted by the monstrous [Dr. Mortimer](../other-characters/krest-mortimer.md).

Now an assassin of the [Spider](../regions/rathe/pits/blackjacks-mercenary-group.md#the-spider), this Arakni takes the jobs that give even the other Arakni pause. Its chaotic aberrations enable it to slip into target locations deemed impregnable, and it relishes those jobs that border on suicide. For if Southmaw couldnâ€™t kill it, nothing could.

Rumors say it steals into Southmaw in the dead of night, never seen nor heard. The only evidence of its passage being the blood-stained surgical tools and empty bottles of alchemical elixir left in its wake. Some might disregard the rumors, but know this: however much Patient 1131 has been transformed by the deathly pressures of Southmaw, it is still in the process of becoming.

    <b>Stealth</b><br>
    Stealth is a deadly tool in the right hands, and Arakni knows how to keep their targets in the dark. With their ability to play multiple cards with stealth in a turn, you never know what's hiding around the corner...
