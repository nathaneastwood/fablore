You are the spider, plucking at the threads, drawing your prey ever closer. You are at the center of the trap, weaving your plans. Yet you are not alone. The others are watching, waiting with fatal patience. They will take your place, when the time is ripe as the carved bone dice of chaos decides. For a conspiracy is made of many connections, of which you are but one. And all know that it takes an entire web to catch the fly.

Arakni, Marionette is a living creation of mortal design and intent. It is a masterwork of sculpted flesh and decanted blood, fashioned by hidden hands in secret places. It is more than a mere killer. It is the culmination of dangerous research and apocalyptic aspirations, of the finest minds driven into feverish inspiration.

This is a predator that stalks the top of the chain, the beautiful beast that hunts the hunters.
