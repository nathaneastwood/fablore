In [Volthaven](../world-of-rathe/aria/the-land-of-legends.md#volthaven), they say I'm quick to bolt...hard to trace...

It's true, I am lightning fast and full of spark. But foremost, my parents named me Aurora, Shooting Star, because of my shocking good looks and innate brilliance.

But seriously, life is a wild ride that I'm determined to enjoy to the fullest. I know what it's like to be held back by naysayers, and that's why I savor every thrill, every adventure.

For anyone who sees only the hurdles, I'll show them how to zap their worries on the free fall-if they're brave enough to take the leap. No-one's snapped back from adversity like I have. That's what sets me apart from the more 'celebrated' wayfarers around here. Where they shoot high, I vault for the sky.

Speaking of vaults. [Enion](../world-of-rathe/aria/the-land-of-legends.md#volthaven) is a treasure trove of them, created back in [Yvor](../world-of-rathe/aria/the-land-of-legends.md#volthaven)'s day. They're scattered all across these floating isles. I've heard the stories, learned the old tricks, and now I've made it my mission to open every single one.

Ready to join the expedition?

There could be ancient artifacts in it for you. Or some musty books. Maybe some cryptic engravings. And traps! Ooh, I love it when there's traps.
