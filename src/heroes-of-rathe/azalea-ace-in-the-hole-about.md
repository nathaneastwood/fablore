Azalea is an obsessive, self-serving contract killer from the depths of the [Pits](https://legendarystories.net/world-of-rathe/pits/pits.html).

A life on the streets has made Azalea cynical and restless. In the Pits, anarchy reigns supreme, and a single mistake can mean the difference between life and death. Even though she has come a long way, Azalea has yet to realise that she is just one small cog in the giant, decrepit machine of the Pits...
