![benji-the-piercing-wind](https://d2hl7maqck52px.cloudfront.net/heroes-of-rathe/benji.webp)

Deep within the Gorge of a Thousand Winds, a young ninja trains alone, as swift and sharp as the racing winds that tear into the rock face below. As a member of the Mugenshi clan, Benji is keenly aware of the threats that lie beyond the gorge, and those who would see his clan erased altogether.

In spite of his age, Benji is diligent and focused, harnessing his innate talent through years of careful study. He deeply respects the Mugenshi elders, and hopes to one day number among the most skilled members of his clan. A devoted student, he has dedicated himself to the task at hand, working to hone his skills and uphold the ancient traditions of the Mugenshi.

A swift and technical fighter, Benji has learned to use his size to his advantage, whittling down his opponents with a flurry of attacks. Yet as a storm brews on the horizon, one question remains: will Benji be able to protect his clan from the trials that lie ahead?

    <b>Evasive as the Wind</b><br>
    Dipping and darting on the fly lines that traverse Mistcloak Gully has taught Benji the art of the wind wisp. Benji's young age is not to be underestimated, as he uses his playful flexibility and small stature to duck and weave past unwitting opponents, piercing like the wind through the smallest of openings. Benji blows a breath of fresh air into Ninja deck design, rewarding you for playing many blue and yellow cards that other Ninja fail to make impactful. When the blue cards in your deck are legitimate sources of damage, it frees up the valuable red line slots to carry the weight of defense.
