"_Fame and Glory? Pffft, @#$& that. All I needs is winning bets, the taste of blood from the swing of muh club, and top-shelf booze to wash it all down._"

Betsy is a head-smashing wrecking ball in the Deathmatch Arena. She thrives in the havoc, her aggression a savage hurricane leaving nothing but only battered wreckage behind, reveling in the bare-knuckled ecstasy of the arena. Not caring for glory or proving herself, Betsy lives only for the rush of the arena-her own paradise where chaos feels like comfort, and the crowd's roars are her anthem.

The coin she earns never sticks around long, quickly becoming the ticket to extravagant bets and premium drinks. In these raw streets, Betsy savors every moment, aware that life remains simple as long as she's the one standing at the end of a match. Amid the pandemonium, Betsy is living her best life.

    Betsy has spent her whole life in the shadow of the Deathmatch Arena, and she's embraced all of its bombast, spectacle, and occasional degeneracy in everything she does. Nothing motivates Betsy quite like a big bet on herself-and the eventual payday that can finance her indulgent life style.

    Luckily for Betsy, her confidence in her performance is well-founded. With massive, towering attacks that bring unique troubles to her opponents, Betsy is a Deathmatch Arena fan favorite, always willing to go big for the crowds that pile in to see her fight.
