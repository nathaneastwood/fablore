Briar is a Warden of the Rosetta, an Order of powerful spell weavers that once stood alongside the likes of the Ollin and the Seers.

Towards the end of the Third Age, the Rosetta suffered heavy casualties at the hands of the Old Ones. When all hope seemed lost, their Queen cast a reckless spell that turned the tide of battle, igniting the essence of [Davnir](~Davnir) to preserve their fading spirits. As the dust settled, the Queen woke from her slumber and gathered up the spirits of her people, planting them as seeds so that they may begin their life anew. But like the Queen, they too became trapped within Candlehold, as they became one with the essence of Davnir.

While her brothers and sisters were seeded in friendly pastures, Briar landed amongst the bramble and thorns at the furthest edges of Candlehold. Despite these inhospitable conditions, she stood strong and resilient, and in time she bloomed into a powerful Warden. As Briar came of age, her power became evident to all, for her grove extended out of Candlehold and connected with the rest of [Aria](../regions/rathe/aria/aria.md); she alone could break the grip of Davnir's mighty essence, and escape into the outside world.

Though her brothers and sisters had become content within their slice of paradise, Briar was filled with a desire to spread her roots far and wide. She would be the first of the Rosetta to set foot outside Candlehold since the time of the Ancients, bringing with her the tidings of her people, and the start of a brand new adventure.

    <b>Sword and Sorcery</b><br>
    Runeblades are the only class truly able to wield equal parts magic and might. Split arcane and melee damage types allow Briar to attack from multiple angles, preying on whatever vulnerabilities the enemy may have. Include a mix of attack action cards and 'non-attack' action cards in your deck to make the most of her Runeblade class type.

    <b>Essence of Earth</b><br>
    From the Earth we grow, and to the Earth we return, in an endless cycle of renewal that endures all. Briar harnesses both tenets of Earth, but none more so than growth, with her many effects that grow the power and defense of her cards.
