Deep within the [Demonastery](../regions/rathe/demonastery/demonastery.md), the Disciples of Pain work to unlock the true bounds of human potential; their goal, to free all of Rathe from the oppression of [Solana](../regions/rathe/solana/solana.md). Through embracing pain, they are able to reach a higher state of being, and surpass their own mortality.

Raised within the Disciples, Chane is a gifted caster and researcher, who has wholeheartedly devoted himself to the pursuit of knowledge. Having become an apostle of the order, Chane is burdened with duty, unified with his brothers in their noble quest to protect humanity from the return of the Aesir, whose vast, arcane power would quickly overwhelm the land of Rathe. After spending many, many months researching and reading, he finally found the key; a whisper of powerful beings who could stand against the Aesir. Thus, he and his fellow disciples have sought a way to weaken the old ones and harness their arcane energy to their own ends.

It was when the gateway to Ã­Arathael was opened, and he and his brethren ventured through to the other side, that Chane finally found the very power he had been searching for. A dark, ominous presence now conceals itself within his shadow, whispering in his ear, tempting him with greater power and the allure of forbidden knowledge. Even as he races to make this power his own, feeding and placating Ursur with the souls of the Light, he walks a razor-thin line on the very edge of the Void. One wrong move, and Chane's soul shall be lost forever.

    Delving into the dark arts of Arcana, Chane found and became bound to the fiendish Ursur, who bestowed upon him great power in exchange for a caveat over his soul. Chane now finds himself shackled to his Shadow pact; Use the dark arts or die.

    <b>Sword & Sorcery</b><br>
    Chane possesses the classic traits of a Runeblade, a hybrid fighter wielding equal parts magic and melee. A potent Runeblade is able to exploit whatever vulnerabilities the enemy has, by attacking from multiple angles with damage sources split between melee and arcane.
