A young mechanologist from the city's elite caste, Dash is a brilliant inventor full of wild ideas and the spark of genius. Born into the city of tomorrow to scientists of Teklo Industries, she grew up surrounded by some of the greatest minds in all of Rathe. And as she explored the world around her, she fell in love with the city, all the goods and bads that lay within.

Stubborn and rebellious, Dash's energetic nature often gets her into trouble. Once she has an idea, it's nigh impossible to dissuade her. And even though the Teklo name has allowed her to follow her whims, she despises the rigid dullness of [Metrix](../world-of-rathe/metrix/metrix.md)'s upper class, and would do anything to avoid becoming just like them.

    <b>Inventor Extraordinaire</b><br>
    As the daughter of Teklo Industries top scientists, Dash has access to the latest technology and tools to be found in Metrix. Despite the wealth of resources at her disposal, Dash finds inspiration from experimentation with odds and ends she comes across in the [Midtown Markets](../world-of-rathe/metrix/a-sprawling-metropolis.md#midtown-markets) and junkyards beyond the city limits.

    While Dash's parents wished their daughter would enjoy the comfort and safety of the elitist life in the spires of Teklo Industries HQ, Dash would rather strap on her steam-powered exoskeleton rig, and run amok across the midtown markets. Boost your way to victory, but keep an eye on your tank (your deck), cos there's nothing more frustrating than running out of gas with the finish line in sight!

    <b>Power of Steam</b><br>
    Mechanologists are driven by the pursuit of alternative energy sources to take the city of Metrix to the reaches of tomorrow and beyond! Metrix is in the age of steam, which Dash uses to power many of the contraptions she invents and uses. Steam items are able to be charged up, converting energy to steam, which can be stored for efficient future outputs.
