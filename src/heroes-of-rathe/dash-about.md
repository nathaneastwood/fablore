A young mechanologist from the city's elite caste, Dash is a brilliant inventor full of wild ideas and the spark of genius. Born into the city of tomorrow to scientists of Teklo Industries, she grew up surrounded by some of the greatest minds in all of Rathe. And as she explored the world around her, she fell in love with the city, all the goods and bads that lay within.

Stubborn and rebellious, Dash's energetic nature often gets her into trouble. Once she has an idea, it's nigh impossible to dissuade her. And even though the Teklo name has allowed her to follow her whims, she despises the rigid dullness of [Metrix](../world-of-rathe/metrix/metrix.md)'s upper class, and would do anything to avoid becoming just like them.

    <b>Inventor Extraordinaire</b><br>
    As the daughter of Teklo Industries top scientists, Dash has access to the latest technology and tools to be found in Metrix. Despite the wealth of resources at her disposal, Dash finds inspiration from experimentation with odds and ends she comes across in the [Midtown Markets](../world-of-rathe/metrix/a-sprawling-metropolis.md#midtown-markets) and junkyards beyond the city limits.

    While Dash's parents wished their daughter would enjoy the comfort and safety of the elitist life in the spires of Teklo Industries HQ, Dash would rather strap on her steam-powered exoskeleton rig, and run amok across the midtown markets. Boost your way to victory, but keep an eye on your tank (your deck), cos there's nothing more frustrating than running out of gas with the finish line in sight!

    <b>Power of Steam</b><br>
    Mechanologists are driven by the pursuit of alternative energy sources to take the city of Metrix to the reaches of tomorrow and beyond! Metrix is in the age of steam, which Dash uses to power many of the contraptions she invents and uses. Steam items are able to be charged up, converting energy to steam, which can be stored for efficient future outputs.

# Dash, I/O

No one epitomizes the [City of Wonder](../world-of-rathe/metrix/metrix.md) like Dash Teklo.

She is the kind of citizen [Teklovossen](./teklovossen-about.md) himself counted on: intelligent, innovative, and able to see potential at every turn. Even as a young inventor full of wild ideas, Dash stood apart from her mechanologist peers.

Born to scientists from [Teklo Industries](../world-of-rathe/metrix/a-better-tomorrow.md#teklo-industries), Dash grew up surrounded by some of the greatest minds in all of Rathe. Many view her as a whizbang in an otherwise stable system, her exploits and energetic nature often getting her into trouble. No matter how hard these Teklo elites try, they cannot get her to toe the industry line. And understandably so! An optimistic outlier, Dash is bored by the rigid dullness of [Metrix](../world-of-rathe/metrix/metrix.md)'s scientific class, and will do anything to avoid becoming just another pencil-pushing whitecoat.

As she has grown and explored, Dash has fallen in love with the city, embracing all the goods and bads that lay within. Some of her fondest memories are of her anti-legal antics with the Rosario Hills kids, their devious fun and games spanning the skyscrapers of the [Expanse](../world-of-rathe/metrix/a-sprawling-metropolis.md#the-expanse) and the dingy digs of [Lowlake](../world-of-rathe/metrix/a-sprawling-metropolis.md#lowlake).

Perhaps that's why, against her better judgment, she still listens to [Maxx Nitro](./maxx-about.md) and his hairbrained schemes?

The longer she spends with the anarchists, the deeper into conspiracy she falls. And there's truth in their theories. More going on than the [Iron Assembly](../world-of-rathe/metrix/a-better-tomorrow.md#iron-assembly) allows its citizens to know.

But what?

Dash is equipped and ready to find out.

    <b>Ghost in the Shell</b><br>
    Long buried under the Iron Assembly, [Data Doll](./data-doll-mkii-about.md) has finally been cut free from her prison. Now she aids Dash on her adventures, learning and processing, experiencing what life has to offer outside the cold steel tomb she was once confined to.

    <b>Cracking the Code</b><br>
    Data Doll's unmatched processing power is the perfect tool to compliment Dash's extraordinary ingenuity. Dash thinks up an invention and Data Doll provides the computations needed to construct it. Together they can produce groundbreaking technology in an instant!
