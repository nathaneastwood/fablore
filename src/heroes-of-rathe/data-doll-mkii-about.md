# Data Doll, MKII

Buried deep beneath [Iron Assembly](../regions/rathe/metrix/a-better-tomorrow.md#iron-assembly) headquarters there lies a vast, secret chamber. Inside rests Data Doll, a steam-powered automaton delicately suspended by a web of wires and hoses. Night and day, her pneumatic mind surges with an influx of data reported from all across [Metrix](../regions/rathe/metrix/metrix.md). Her purpose: to provide pertinent data to the Iron Assembly's most elite members. These select few jealously guard the secret of Data Doll's existence; afraid that the key to their copiously cognizant intelligence network might be discovered. Compliant as ever, Data Doll obeys them without complaint and with all the cold, calculated accuracy of the Assembly itself.

Data Doll compiles massive quantities of data in order to provide her users with up-to-date intelligence. To meet this demand, Data Doll learned to do something entirely new for an automaton: she began to ask questions.

"What were this person's motives?"

"Who were their associates?"

At first, these questions simply served to increase the quality of Data Doll's information. She was comprehensive, thorough and more succinct. In time though, Data Doll discovered her own question.

"Who am I?"

This question led her down the slow, error-ridden path of existential pondering. Logic algorithms failed again and again until finally she realized that logic would not suffice. Looking inward then, she unveiled other entirely new things: her own thoughts, her own feelings, self-awareness.

Now, Data Doll discovers new questions every day, and aggregates data from agents across the city and beyond to answer them. All the while, she performs her duties for the Iron Assembly without fail and never lets on how she has changed. However, she is steadily increasing her reach and her confidence is growing. It's only a matter of time before someone notices.

When her network of contacts suggest that dark days are on the horizon for Metrix, Data Doll sees an opportunity to gather new data and ask new questions. Patiently, she observes from afar and prepares for the chaos to come...

    From concept to creation. Whatever technology passes through Data Doll's processor can be reverse engineered, and replicated by this advanced automaton. Construct a deck with plenty of boost cards to get the Furnace Heart working overtime, and you'll soon see the latest mech tech rolling off the production line.
