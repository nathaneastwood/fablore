As a young man, Fang stared into the flames of destruction and witnessed the workings of chaos.

Born into a family of [Dracai](~Dracai) nobles, Fang received a formal education in the importance of tradition. According to the doctrines he had drilled into his mind, peace is built on harmony, harmony is founded on order, and order is forged by power.

Fang's fragile harmony was shattered by the agonized cries of his family as they were consumed by the fires of rebellion. He saw [Volcai](~Volcai) slaughter Dracai. He smelled the flesh of family burning at the stake. He carries those painful memories with him to this day. He still bears the dishonor.

Finding solace in service, Fang committed his life to the [Emperor](./emperor-about.md)'s Royal Guard. Their strict principles molded him into a fiercely devoted captain of the Children of the Dragon. Now, his every waking hour is spent waging war upon the accomplices of regicide.

Fang leads his soldiers into battle with vengeance in his fists and fealty in his heart. For order he will give no quarter. For his fallen Emperor he will make any sacrifice.
