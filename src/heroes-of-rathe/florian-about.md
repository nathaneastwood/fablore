Creatures of [Candlehold](../regions/rathe/aria/the-land-of-legends.md#candlehold), have you heard the news? Death comes to us all, in the end.

They call me the Harbinger, a blight or a blessing, depending on the season. One who walks among the withered and the fallen to remind our reposed [Rosetta](~Rosetta) of the truth.

Those who dwell in the endless summer fear mortality. They fear rot and ruin.

But what is fear to those who cling to a false paradise where life stagnates?

You, dear creatures, understand that life and death are two sides of the same leaf, each giving way to the other. The decay that some Rosetta dread is not an end, but a return to the earth, rich with the promise of renewal.

There is beauty in every wilted petal, poetry in every fallen branch. Here, the real stories are told. The trees whisper of battles fought, lives lived, and echoes in the hollow wood tell the tale.

Let them bask in their illusion of eternal summer. We know the power of the soil beneath us. Fear not the rot, for it is the prelude to rebirth. As long as the leaves fall and the roots drink deep, there will always be a place for those who seek the true face of nature.

Welcome to the Rotwood. May your ending nurture another's beginning.

    <b>Cycle of Life</b><br>
    Death is a necessary arc of the cycle of life. Florian understands this well and uses it to his advantage with effects that sacrifice his own auras as part of the process of creation.

    <b>Sword and Sorcery</b><br>
    As a Runeblade, Florian is a hybrid fighter, wielding both magic and melee in equal measure. Runeblades can attack from multiple angles, preying on the opponent's vulnerabilities with split damage types.
