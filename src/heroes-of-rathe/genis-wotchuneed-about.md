There's talk of a kindly old man that roams the breadth of Aria, carrying upon his back the treasures from a thousand lost kingdoms. They call him the Roaming Bazaar, and what a spectacle he is! A friendly face in unfamiliar lands, a helping hand in your hour of need. His pack overflows with riches both wonderful and strange, as he spreads the joy of the Everfest far and wide.

Of his past, little is known; some say he's a swindler who peddles mullock to the unaware, while others whisper of his mysterious powers that reminds them of the provisioners of old. But out of his endless backpack he pulls forth a million trinkets, baubles, potions and amulets, and all your questions will melt away as you gawk at the joyful things he brings!

So ready your Silvers as you shout his name; Genis' got what chu need!
