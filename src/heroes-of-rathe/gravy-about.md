As a necromantic buccaneer and captain of a ghostly galleon, Gravy Bones sails from the deepest ocean bed to the highest crests of the storm-churned waves. Free of any mortal concerns, Gravy commits his skullduggery wherever he pleases. Except on dry land, that is. It's a cruel twist of fate, yet a small price to pay. After all, Gravy's first love will always be the sea, and his ship, the Dreadnought, is the only home he's ever known. And it's to his second love, treasure, that he devotes every moment of his immortality.

Before voyaging into undeath, Gravy Bones built his pirate name through wild boldness and macabre ferocity. It is said that Bones, during a pitched sea battle, ripped his rival captain's still-beating heart right out of his chest and took a big bite out of it. The entire enemy crew surrendered on the spot. In fact, Bones' morbid reputation grew so notorious that merchant and pirate ships alike would raise the white flag at the mere sight of the Dreadnought on the horizon.

Yet, there is one thing that even Gravy Bones couldn't frighten into submission. Time.

The pirate's life takes its toll, even on those who love it so dearly, and Captain Bones foresaw his imminent end in the ebbing tides of his aging heart. So he set sail for [Dreadfall Reach](../world-of-rathe/high-seas/dreadfall-reach.md) and a little-known necropolis harboring morbid secrets.

The terror of the sea sank beneath the surf, only to rise once more. Yet, where would a necromantic captain be without his ship and his crew? One by one, dying such deaths that only a pirate would dare, Bones' loyal mateys became his zombie horde. Even the Dreadnought herself followed suit, the ship going down with her captain.

Gravy Bones now prowls strange tides and the drowning deep, seeking ancient treasures and welcoming those who resist him to join his cadaverous crew. If Death itself couldn't stop Gravy Bones, what hope does anyone else have?

    <b>Lost and Found</b><br>
    Even in death, nothing is ever truly lost. Gravy can throw cards overboard to drown in the deep blue sea, only to fish them back up for some swashbuckling skullduggery.
