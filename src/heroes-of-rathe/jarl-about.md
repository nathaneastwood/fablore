In the tales of old, he was the Fury of the Frostlands, tempered for battle by the powers of the Ancients. A Guardian with an insatiable thirst for violence, fighting for the last vestiges of humanity in an age of carnage.

At the Battle of [Isenloft](../world-of-rathe/aria/the-land-of-legends.md#isenloft), [Rathe](../world-of-rathe/world-of-rathe.md)'s final stand against the Old Ones, Jarl Vetreiđi fought at the vanguard of the Ollin, the first into the fray. With concentrated might, they repelled the ravenous hordes, Jarl's reputation reinforced with every swing of his deadly weapon.

And when, after months of grisly warfare, all hope seemed lost, the Ancients made the ultimate sacrifice; a cataclysmic act to restore peace to the lands - an act that entombed Jarl and the Ollin in ice upon frozen battlefields.

Years have passed, the threats from the Third Age long gone. Yet, on the winds sweeping the Isen Ranges, the pulse of the Ancients prevails. And by the will of [The Flow](../world-of-rathe/aria/a-true-sanctuary.md#the-flow), the ironclad Guardian has thawed from his frozen tomb into a Rathe transformed.

Long trapped beneath the ice, Jarl is free and filled with fury. Now, no matter how far he must travel and to what ends he must go, war is what he will find, leaving [Aria](../world-of-rathe/aria/aria.md) with fearsome tales to spin in his bloody wake.

    <b>Ice in His Veins</b><br>
    Hailing from Isenloft, Jarl is attuned to the Elements of Ice and Earth, but the icy chill of the Northern Winds calls to him in a special way. Your Ice cards will freeze your opponents to their very core, punishing every inch of exposed skin.

    Jarl will show both heroes and equipment how fleeting existence is in the world of Rathe. Powerful Elemental effects can cause equipment to become brittle and shatter, making way for the cold to do its thing on bare flesh.

    Jarl is happy to pick up a shield, but his true power is displayed as the match wears on and his signature weapon, Summit, the Unforgiving, becomes even more powerful. The cost may be high, but the pain for opponents is immeasurable.
