Descended from nobility, Kano was born with the power of the dragon's fire within his veins, able to shape the flames from the instant he drew his first breath. A cunning trickster yet undeniably gifted with a connection to aether, he is both admired and scorned by the other Lord Wizards of the Court.

As a member of the royal court, Kano must inevitably take on his duty, and accept his place amongst the [Dracai](~Dracai). But Kano, he'd rather focus on exploring age-old tomes in the deepest recess of the libraries, or hidden within ancient catacombs, for spells and tricks to control and amplify his flame.

    <b>Aether to Arcane</b><br>
    Aether is the central knowledge base of all arcane arts in Rathe, which Kano draws from to summon arcane damage amongst his other wizardry. Unlike melee fighters who trade blows using the combat chain, defending arcane damage requires energy to be channeled through special equipment or items with Arcane Barrier, or to use damage prevention effects.

    <b>Master of Time</b><br>
    Kano is the first hero of Flesh and Blood who is able to play the game at instant speed...and playing games with his enemies (and allies) is what Kano lives for! An opponent who takes one step too many, pushes when they should hold, is over zealous in their onslaught, may find the jokes on them before they know it.

    <b>Dragonblood</b><br>
    Only those with the blood of the dragon can hold a position of Dracai in the royal court of <a href="https://legendarystories.net/continents/rathe/volcor/volcor.html">Volcor</a>. Being a Dracai of Aether is one part training and one lineage, and with it Kano expands on the general knowledge base of Aether to learn the arcane specialization of Draconic magic.
