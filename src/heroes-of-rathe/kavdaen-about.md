![kavdaen-trader-of-skins](https://d2hl7maqck52px.cloudfront.net/heroes-of-rathe/kavdaen.webp)

Deep underground, where the streets of the Maw are cast in perpetual darkness, a black market thrives. Targeting the desperate and the dying, Kavdaen steps out of the shadows, extending a helping hand. When all hope seems lost, he provides a second chance, offering a loan to help people make a name for themselves. Yet when their deal inevitably falls through, their business venture plagued by a string of extraordinarily bad luck, Kavdaen will come calling once more, seeking his dues. With their life in ruins, the only thing his victims have left to offer is their own flesh and blood.

While Kavdaen may present himself as a salesman, his true passion lies in the arts. One of the most well-known names in his field, Kavdaen has established a reputation for his abstract, yet lifelike sculptures. Of course, he uses only the finest materials for his projects, carefully dissecting each body to harvest every last scrap of flesh and bone. Some of the most powerful players in the [Pits](../world-of-rathe/pits/pits.md) have purchased Kavdaen's creations, enjoying the grotesque nature of his work. Sometimes, he even gets customers from the surface, making the long trip down into the Maw just to claim one of his sculptures for themselves.

The atmosphere of paranoia and dread that plagues the underground is Kavdaen's bread and butter, providing the perfect environment to prey upon the weak. However, in recent times, strange new creatures have been sighted in the underground tunnels, encroaching on the outskirts of the Maw. Their appearance has rattled the denizens of the Pits, causing a new breed of fear to spread through the squalid streets. As more and more desperate people look for a way out, Kavdaen is there with a crooked smile, selling the illusion of hope...and business is booming.

Never one to take advantage of those less fortunate, oh no no, Kavdaen always recompenses in equal, pound for pound; copper to flesh.
