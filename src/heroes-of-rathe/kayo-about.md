# Kayo, Beserker Runt

On the outskirts of a vast jungle, where dense undergrowth gives way to the fiery, barren wastes, one brute marks his territory in blood and ash. Amid the cracked earth and sweltering heat, Kayo fights off savage lava beasts and swarms of massive insects, trading blow for blow in vicious battles to the death.

As a cub, Kayo was born small and slow; a death sentence within the jungles of the [Savage Lands](https://legendarystories.net/world-of-rathe/savage-lands/savage-lands.html). In his struggle to survive, he wandered further and further to the east, trying in vain to escape the predators that stalked him through the trees. However, as time passed, instinct took over, bloodlust driving him to challenge beasts three times his size. What Kayo lacks in size and strength, he makes up for with sheer ferocity, tearing his prey apart piece by bloody piece.

In the badlands, Kayo fights for every inch of territory, staving off both savage jungle predators and virulent lava beasts. No matter the creature, no matter the battle, he throws himself into every fight without fear, driven by the will to survive. However, as unrest creeps across the land, he may soon find himself battling far stranger creatures than the ones he's faced before.

## Hero Highlights

#### Knock Out!

Kayo is a dangerous little mongrel; a product of survival in the Savage Lands. All it takes is one big hit to land to lay an opponent out for the count. Brutes have some of the biggest hits in the game, so when Kayo's got his roll on, he's packing a KO punch!
