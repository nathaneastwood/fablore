Lyath's father is Bloodworth Goldmane, and his mother, Tara VanGeld, is of full-blooded dwarven heritage. The VanGeld clan traces its lineage back to the infamous Myrkhellir, ancient betrayer of Anvilheim.

Being born to the richest noble house in the [Northern Realms](~NorthernRealms), Lyath was raised in luxury and treated like a lord. Yet he abandoned his privileged position for one simple yet inescapable reason. Boredom. Lyath's innate intellect was beyond that of his Goldmane peers, and he soon saw through their petty struggles for influence and intrigue. He could have played their game and won, but that would have been too easy. Instead he took up another challenge: to succeed in a realm with neither rules nor reason. [Deathmatch](../regions/rathe/deathmatch/destination-deathmatch.md).

Of course, Lord Bloodworth Goldmane would never support such madness, so Lyath joined forces with the black sheep of the family, [Victor](../heroes-of-rathe/victor-goldmane-about.md), and together they traveled to the edge of the [Savage Lands](../regions/rathe/savage-lands/savage-lands.md).

For a while, Lyath soaked in the mad spectacle of Deathmatch, observing Victor's battles and managing his extra-arena business like a biomancer watching a rat in a maze. During this time he practiced and prepared, physically and mentally, and is now ready to enter [Super Slam](~SuperSlam). He has befriended, bought and blackmailed the right people, both inside and outside the ring. And best of all, he's fabricated a nefarious identity that will keep everyone thoroughly entertained, right to the top of the game.
