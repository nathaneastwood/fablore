Marlynn's the kind of pirate who'll saunter into a tavern, shout everyone a drink to put them at ease, merrily shoot the piano player for fumbling a note, then entertain the shocked crowd with a rousing sea shanty of her own.

Raised on a pirate ship, Marlynn witnessed her talented sailing and harpooning mother have to swab the deck for a dull-witted braggart; Captain Cooder of the Swiftwater. When Cooder's reckless raiding got her mother killed, Marlynn worked her charms on the crew and orchestrated a mutiny.

Since then, Marlynn has never taken orders from anyone. Yes, she'll accept bounties for sea monsters and strategic raids, but it's her way or the plank for crew and clients alike. She keeps her motley mob of privateers in line with a heady cocktail of wild glamor and willful violence. They love her, they fear her, and they will follow her off the edge of the High Seas. For their loyalty, Marlynn rewards them handsomely with fine hunting and fair shares of the plunder.

Marlynn now captains one of the fastest, most nimble ships on the water, yet Marlynn pushes even this exceptional craft to its limits as she chases ever larger and more dangerous bounties. Some say the ambitious Marlynn will one day meet a fish too big for even her, one that will drag her down to the bottom of the sea, hook, line and sinker. Marlynn doesn't see it that way. As far as she's concerned, she'd rather live large and die young than be a worm on someone else's hook.

    Marlynn's after the big prizes, and for that she needs something that'll overpower even the mightiest foe. After all, it takes a crew to sail a ship and a cannon to sink it.
