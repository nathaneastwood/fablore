_As the applause of the crowd ended, Cox's voice rang out "Listen, good people, to the story of Olympia-the enigmatic fighter who rose from obscurity to become one of our time's greatest fighters."_

Olympia spent his early years as a beggar, surviving on scraps, in the Moat of the Deathmatch Arena. However, destiny had other plans for him, as he would rise from the littered streets to become the 'Undefeated Deathmatch Champion'. His journey has been a gruesome spectacle from his bloody first fight to his relentless streak of title defenses, earning him nicknames like the 'The Eternal' and 'Prized Fighter'.

Olympia has captivated audiences with his violent showmanship, each clash balancing sportsmanship with the sharp edge of his sword. A beacon to aspiring fighters, the Arena has embraced him as their veteran, standing tall amidst a graveyard of challengers who dared to cross his path.

The very arena that molded him is now the house that he built. His name, once barely a whisper amongst beggars, now roars amidst the thunderous applause of the crowd. Olympia stands as the powerhouse of the Arena, his legend embodying the strength of the Deathmatch.

    <b>The Ultimate Prized Fighter</b><br>
    In Olympia's eyes, there is only the competition of the arena. Every other aspect of his life is just noise. He eats, breathes, and sleeps competition, and believes the only thing worth betting on is himself. To Olympia, ever increasing stakes aren't just a source of livelihood, they are a way to prove his worth and further outshine his opponents after their inevitable defeat.
