Raised as a bannerwoman in the [Northern Realms](~NorthernRealms), Pleiades served as a field musician within the army of House Ashwood. She set the march with her drum beats and sounded the charge with her bugle calls. She celebrated the brave with ballads and played dirges for the dead.

When the Ashwood army was decimated by House Goldmane, Pleiades beat a tactical retreat to [Gougemoor](~Gougemoor) rather than become a vassal to her sworn enemy. Since then she has made a name for herself as both a performer and powerful competitor in Super Slam.

Pleiades is as savvy as she is mesmerizing. She has formed a tight warband of musicians, and attracted a veritable army of fans. While her virtuoso performances enrapture the crowd, her days of soldiering have tempered her into a resilient fighter who can handle herself as well in the arena as she does on the stage. So beware any Goldmane that dares to meet her in battle.
