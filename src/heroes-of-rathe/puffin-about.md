An explorer and treasure hunter with an insatiable curiosity, this airfaring freebooter will stop at nothing to uncover the secrets of the High Seas. Piracy is a means to an end for Captain Puffin, a sure-fire way to fund her expeditions. While her more sneaky sidekick, Polly Cranka, would prefer more pillaging than exploration, Puffin and Polly can still agree that gold is better spent in the pursuit of knowledge than fattening some merchant's purse.

Before throwing caution and conformity to the wind, Puffin toiled as an airship mechanic for the family firm in Piper's Pier, a dirty and dangerous job that cost her a leg. Yet she'd always dreamed of clear skies and far horizons, so when her larcenous parrot, Polly, stole a promising treasure map, she traded in her socket wrench for a spyglass and answered the call to adventure!

Puffin purchased her first rickety airship, the Golden Goose, and launched her maiden voyage. With a cunning plan and plenty of cogent jury-rigging on the mechanologist's part, Puffin and Polly swiped Captain Rue's treasure chest from the very ghouls that slew him in [Dreadfall Reach](../regions/high-seas/dreadfall-reach/dreadfall-reach.md). Though Polly was injured during the daring caper, requiring a new wing of Puffin's fashioning, Rue's gold enabled them to expand their operation and hire a hearty crew.

She and Polly have the combined smarts and nous to waylay both merchants and marauders, though Puffin favors hit-and-run tactics over pitched battles. She's motivated by neither carnage nor conquest. It's curiosity that drives Puffin, and gold that fuels her forays.

Though the modest Puffin would never claim this about herself, her crew have witnessed her literally laughing in the face of danger. Pirates and eldritch powers, sea monsters and murderous storms, these are just signs that she's on the right track. For our daring Puffin has learned that where there's the highest risk, there's ofttimes the greatest reward.
