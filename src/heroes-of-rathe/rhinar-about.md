    <p>In the depths of the <a href="https://legendarystories.net/world-of-rathe/savage-lands/savage-lands.html">Savage Lands</a>, a lone brute has carved out his territory in blood and bone. Abandoned to the mercy of the jungle as a cub, he fought to survive, fending off vicious beasts and scavengers. Yet this struggle has forged an alpha predator, relentless and unflinching, tearing through anything that gets in his way.</p>
    <p>Reckless, savage and uncontrollable, Rhinar is driven by his bloodlust and base instincts. When he fights, he enters a bloody frenzy. Everything around him becomes a threat, the ground turning slick with blood as he blindly butchers everything in his path.</p>

        <b>Strong Survive</b><br>
        The rule of the Savage Lands is simple; The Strong Survive. "Strength matters" is shown by the many brute cards and effects that are turned on by attacks with 6 or more power.

    <p>From the heart of the <a href="https://legendarystories.net/world-of-rathe/savage-lands/savage-lands.html">Savage Lands</a>, Rhinar hungers for the savage thrill of the hunt. Fueled by a relentless bloodrage, he has wandered the untamed wilderness, seeking something mighty enough to quench his primal thirst. However, his instincts have pulled him North-guiding him to a new battleground, the Deathmatch Arena.</p>
    <p>To Rhinar, the arena is an extension of his savage dominion. Here, he confronts Rathe's mightiest creatures, tearing them apart with a lethal blend of raw power and cunning. The arena-masters, stunned by his ferocity, have thrust him into the limelight as their spectacle of unbridled brutality. Yet, fame means nothing to Rhinar; he craves only the satisfaction of sating his insatiable bloodlust and solidifying his reign as Rathe's apex predator.</p>
    <p>Feared by foes and celebrated by crowds, Rhinar pays no mind to the adoration or disdain swirling around him. Indifferent to the roars of spectators, he heeds only his primal instincts. With reckless abandon, he unleashes his reckless rampage on any fool who crosses his path, etching his name as an unstoppable force in the Deathmatch Arena.</p>
