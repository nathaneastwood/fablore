Welcome, traveler. Plant your feet in the soil. Feel the arable earth that nourishes these forests.

The name's Terra, guardian of these sacred lands, born from the heart of [Korshem](../regions/rathe/aria/a-true-sanctuary.md#the-korshem) to tend to and protect all that grows in [Aria](../regions/rathe/aria/aria.md). These woods, nestled into Mount Heroic, are my chosen domain - each tree, each blade of grass, every creature here is like kin to me.

The earth and I, we have an understanding. It speaks to me in its own way, in the groan of old roots and the shift of stones, and I listen. Always.

When danger rears its ugly head - be it creeping dread or ancient terror - I stand ready to defend. The stones rise to shield the weak, and the roots bind anything that means harm. My hands were made for nurturing, but don't think for a moment they won't crush a threat to this sanctuary. I'll do whatever it takes to keep Aria's natural beauty alive and thriving.

So, if ever you need a place to rest your bones, know that the earth will welcome you, and so will I. Together, we'll tend this great garden we call home.
