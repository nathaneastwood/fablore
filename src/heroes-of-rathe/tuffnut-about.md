His immense strength and towering toughness enabled Tuffnut to rise to be a Gorelord of a small tribe, but he was too trusting to hold the position for long. Overthrown by a more cunning and vicious rival, Tuffnut was driven out of his tribal territory. Too much of a pack animal to go it alone, Tuffnut found himself drawn to the hubbub of [Deathmatch](../regions/rathe/deathmatch/destination-deathmatch.md) and became a willing contestant.

Due to the unusually high number of herdish herbivores in his 'birth midden', Tuffnut is a rare Brute who loves to be loved. He 'thinks' of every battle as a play fight, where new friends visit for fun sessions of rough and tumble. And the audience has become Tuffnut's pack. He will do anything for his fans.

Outside of the arena, Tuffnut is a simple Brute with simple needs. He's happy as long as he has plenty of food and a comfy haystack to sleep on. That said, he understands "hoomun-tongue", even though he can't speak more than a few words, and is one of the few Brutes that taverns will allow in. After a successful match he's usually co-opted into friendly drinking sessions with his supporters, funded mostly from his own winnings, which Tuffnut struggles to count. Easily taken advantage of in this way, Tuffnut is poor most of the time, but that doesn't worry him. He lives for fun times and cheering fans, nothing more.

    <b>Lucky Lug</b><br>
    A good heart attracts good fortune, at least in Tuffnut's case. This charming numbskull makes up for his naivety by being surprisingly lucky. With the flip of a card, the big lug can literally bumble into victory.

    The crowd loves an unlikely champion, and no one expected Tuffnut to draw the top slot. Now they chant and cheer for their amiable mascot as he overturns expectations with playful abandon.
