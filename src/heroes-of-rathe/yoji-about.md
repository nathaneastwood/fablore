To advance from rank grunt to royal guardian takes discipline and an exceptional nature. It speaks to grueling training and dark nights of tense vigilance. Respect earned with halberd in hand, paid for in the black bruises and spilled blood of violent duty. A pledge of allegiance performed with neither pause nor protest.

Yoji patrols the palace corridors and castellations, orders and rallies his garrison of guards so that the Dracai may practice their rites and play their politics in peace. In Yoji they trust; his stalwart presence, a constant source of comfort and security.

When bandits sought to capture and ransom Lord Wizard Chiyo, he was there to gut their aspirations. When rebel tempers flared among the smelters and smiths of Ashvahan, he was there to crush their hands upon their own anvils. And when the Ezu usurper plotted his sovereign ascent, he was there to hang the tyrant's family from the Grand Archway.

Just as there is no rest for the wicked, Yoji knows that there is no rest for the true. Danger may threaten, but the dynasty's Royal Protector is ready to meet it.
