# Prism, Awakener of Sol

War rages on between the Shadow and the Light.

[Solana](../../continents/rathe/solana/solana.md)'s fields are no longer golden. Where pastures and villages once bathed in the sun, only ravaged earth and scorched skeletons remain. Solana faces the [Demonastery](../../continents/rathe/demonastery/demonastery.md)'s vengeance with neither advantage nor known ally, and with nowhere to run.

Tended to by the Demonastery's favored daughters, [Levia](../../heroes-of-rathe/levia-about.md) and [Vynnset](../../heroes-of-rathe/vynnset-about.md), the Dimenxxional Gate pours forth a dark tide of monstrosity. Pacts sealed in blood and soul with Embra of unspeakable ambition have galvanized the servants of the Shadow, and [Ã­Arathael](../../continents/rathe/demonastery/the-gateway-to-iarathael.md)'s most demiurgic climes continue to exude a horde like no other.

And still, Sol's most faithful fight on. [Shiyana](../../heroes-of-rathe/shiyana-about.md) seeks out the enemy's foulest secrets while [Prism](../../heroes-of-rathe/prism-about.md) scours the city's archives for words of power and hope. [Dorinthea](../../heroes-of-rathe/dorinthea-about.md) and [Boltyn](../../heroes-of-rathe/boltyn-about.md) lead the [Hand of Sol](../../continents/rathe/solana/the-order-of-the-light.md#the-hand-of-sol) in Solana's defense, saving those who can be saved, and avenging those who cannot.

Yet with each grim day, the graveyards swell under a darkening sky. Each fearful sunset, the people of Solana hold out for a dawn they may never see in the endless dusk.
