# Arena Announcements

## Olympia
Gather 'round as we unveil a true colossus of the Arena<br>
Born a beggar on these streets, he built this Arena into his home<br>
Wielding a blade seasoned by hundreds of battles, he's the undisputed Deathmatch champion! Littering the ground with those foolish enough to challenge his title...<br>
Prepare yourselves for a spectacle of excellence, [Olympia](../../heroes-of-rathe/oldhim-about.md#oldhim-grandfather-of-eternity), the Prized Fighter!<br>

## Betsy
She's the unmovable juggernaut of the ring, and our head-smashing spectacle<br>
Unfazed by wealth or glory, watch as she dances through the chaos, spending her winnings on wild bets and the finest booze<br>
She thrives in the Deathmatch Arena, knowing victory is her everlasting companion...<br>
She's got skin in the game, it's [Betsy](../../heroes-of-rathe/betsy-about.md#betsy-skin-in-the-game)!<br>

## Rhinar
Deathmatch fans, you can't imagine how hard it was to get this beast here tonight<br>
You've never witnessed brutality like this before, and you may not even want to...<br>
With killer instincts and intimidating power, get ready for a wild ride<br>
The hunt is on, and only the strong survive!<br>
[Rhinar](../../heroes-of-rathe/rhinar-about.md#rhinar-reckless-rampage), the Reckless Rampage, is here to dominate!<br>

## Kayo
Brace yourselves for a living nightmare<br>
From the depths of the [Savage Lands](../../regions/rathe/savage-lands/savage-lands.md) - captured, mangled, and now reborn in the Arena<br>
Please, stay away from the edges of the arena<br>
This monster's bloodlust knows no bounds<br>
The very essence of savagery, he may be wounded, but he's armed...and dangerous, [Kayo](../../heroes-of-rathe/kayo-about.md#kayo-armed-and-dangerous)!<br>

## Victor
Witness a guardian of grand virtue, draped in the blinding light of [Solana](../../regions/rathe/solana/solana.md)<br>
With fistfuls of wealth and an ego, even bigger than his pockets, we are so lucky he has chosen to grace us with his presence<br>
Will his virtues illuminate his path to victory?<br>
Behold, the Golden Son, [Victor Goldmane](../../heroes-of-rathe/victor-goldmane-about.md#victor-goldmane-high-and-mighty)!<br>

## Kassai
A crimson storm rises from the sands, not just a fighter, but a terror!<br>
With a mind as sharp as her sabres, she paints the arena in blood<br>
Quick, lethal, and utterly merciless, she's just here to collect her coin<br>
With a purpose known only to the gods, "The Terror of the Golden Sand" [Kassai](../../heroes-of-rathe/kassai-about.md#kassai-of-the-golden-sand)!<br>
