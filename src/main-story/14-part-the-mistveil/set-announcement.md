# Part the Mistveil

_For ten thousand years our ancestors have walked the path well traveled._

_Like the tiger stalking its prey... They have waited._

_Like the snake hiding in the murky water... They have waited._

_Like the waning faces of the moon... They have waited._

_Until now._

_The truth lies beyond the mist._

"Welcome traveler, you must be starving. Please come inside. I think we can satisfy your appetite. Anything you like, intimacy or perhaps ecstasy. Come a little closer I won't bite, tell me what do you desire?" - [Nuu](../../heroes-of-rathe/nuu-about.md)

"Beware the tongue of the snake her fangs shall soon follow. Pleasure is but the shallow illusion, walk the true path and you shall see clear. Those who seek may discover, formless, perfect the serene unchanging infinite, eternally present." - [Enigma](../../heroes-of-rathe/enigma-about.md)

"Eternally boring, why don't we play rough." - Nuu

"Embrace the solitude." - Enigma

"Embrace the sensation." - Nuu

"Look within." - Enigma

"Look at me" - Nuu

"Just a breath." - Enigma

"Just a taste." - Nuu

"Enough! A tiger does not fall prey to the snake. The tiger walks its own path. Those who flow as life flows know they need no other force, the heavy is the root of the light, the unmoved the source of all movement, the center is unbound and free." - [Zen](../../heroes-of-rathe/zen-about.md)

"Walk the path seek the truth." - Enigma

# Chi

_Empty your mind. Let your essence ebb, let it flow. Become one with everything, and one with nothing. Transcend beyond the manifestation of the physical._

_Find your inner Chi._

_Find your true self._
