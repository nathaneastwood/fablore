# Golden Port

As ships approach Golden Port, the first thing sailors notice are the colossal twin arches overlooking the entrance to the harbor. One of the few remnants of a [Dhani](~DhaniEmpire) civilization with a penchant for the grandiose, the arches help facilitate ship traffic in and out of the port.

Once inside, the city is a sight to behold. To starboard, a patchwork of silk canopies shimmer in the sun, shading the markets throughout the day, while the soft ocean breeze cools the alleyways. On the port side, a mosaic of houses and communal buildings sprawl over the Dhani ruins, the building stones salvaged from the once-majestic palace of the three golden empresses.

Golden Port's sea spider colonies form glistening, gossamer nets throughout the shallows, and barelegged silk farmers wade and weave in the early hours of morning. Sea spider silk is highly sought after by traders, but it's not the only treasure that Golden Port harbors.

## The Golden Bazaar

It may be a place of commerce, but over time, the labyrinthine Golden Bazaar has developed into the beating heart of Golden Port's social life. From the shaded alleyways to the open plazas, the Bazaar is a feast for the senses. Stalls are decorated with rich cloths, glimmering from gemfish scales embroidered in sea spider silk.

Everywhere the scent of warm, fragrant spices mix with exotic perfumes. Volutes of smoke, sweet and fruity, rise from the haze dens. Everything needed for life's simple pleasures can be found at the Bazaar for a reasonable price, unless one's tastes run to the rare and dangerous.

Local antiquarians brave the catacombs of the dead city to search out relics of precious metals with forgotten powers. Browsing the trinkets of Golden Port's stalls is an act of historical salvage, one that can make the savvy corsair either very rich, or tragically cursed.
