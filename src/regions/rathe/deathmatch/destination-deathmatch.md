# Destination Deathmatch

## Your luxury locale dedicated to dismemberment

Looking for an exciting and exotic destination for your next big journey? Look no further than Gougemoor, home to Deathmatch, with all new events for the exciting bloodsport of SUPER SLAM!

## Cirque du Violence
Our grand arena is the best kept secret in Rathe, but here at Deathmatch we pride ourselves on innovation. With our new Super Slam events, we are pioneering fresh and fierce twists to our winning formula!

## Cage of Carnage
Are you sick of peering from the stands at those tiny fighters in the distance? Join former champion Speakeasy in the Undercroft and get up-close and personal with the Cage of Carnage! Clamber up the sides of the cage for the best view in the house; smell the sweat, taste the blood. A few metal bars are all that stands between you and the action.

## Infernal Maw
Frenzy and flames await you in Batbiter's barbaric barony. Feel the thumping of war drums in your chest. Feel the heat of alchemical pyrotechnics lighting up the arena. Allow yourself to be melted down and forged anew by the heaviest metal majesty of the Infernal Maw!

## Iron Coliseum
High above our main arena, the ingenious fightmaster Rusty has been busy creating the Iron Coliseum! Battling on elevated scaffolds, our fighting contestants will also have to contend with traps and hazards like swinging pendulum scythes and Rusty's nefarious felling bells! Hear the crowd go quiet as a fighter falls from on high. Hear them roar when the body hits the floor.

## Den of Beasts
Sourced for you from the [Savage Lands](../savage-lands/savage-lands.md), we have Fightmaster Moloca's incredible menagerie in the Den of Beasts! She has no love for the fighters, training her monstrous pets to stalk them into extinction! Are you wild enough to enter the jungle to witness this primal contest? Only you can answer that call!

## Savor Every Flavor, Without Limits
Visit the Moat for all your shopping, drinking, and gambling needs! Encircling the Arena, this lawless space is not for the fainthearted. Many an unwary traveler has lost an arm and a leg to the Moat's merciless marketeers. Yet, there are bargains to be found, and outlandish goods that you won't find anywhere else in Rathe!
Preparing to enter a Super Slam event? Head on down to Mad Siv's Forge. Any piece of murder you can imagine, she can create! And if you're lacking inspiration, go see Blind Boggy for predictive visions that make your toes curl right off.

## Needing sustenance?
Grab a cup of Deathmatch Draught and a [brawnhide](../savage-lands/bestiary-of-scarborough.md#brawnhide) steak at the Grinning Boar Cantina. If you're lucky, you might get some free entertainment as revered and reviled champions carry their feuds from the arena to the bar floor.

If it's some visceral excitement you crave, you can't beat Super Slam for a bloodthirsty getaway! And rest assured, apart from a few souvenirs and scars, you need not worry about trouble following you home.
As we like to say: "What happens at Super Slam stays at Super Slam!"
