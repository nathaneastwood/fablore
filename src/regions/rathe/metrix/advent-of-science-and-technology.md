# Advent of Science and Technology

Thanks to the success and continued patronage of Metrix's larger corporations, the scientific and technological communities of Metrix have flourished, creating a city rich with innovation. Mechanologists studying augmentation or robotics; alchemists studying the effects of minerals, plants and poisons; inventors at the forefront of commercial innovation; biomancers who work to push the limits of humanity; researchers studying the natural world; all these and more call Metrix their home.

## Branches of Study
#### Biomancy
The study and manipulation of the physical form, typically concerning humans but can also include other living creatures.

#### Alchemy
The study and manipulation of alchemical, chemical and botanical components, creating potions, poisons, elixirs and concoctions.

#### Mechanology
The study, creation and manipulation of technology; focusing on designing and building machines, structures, and other items.

### Technological Advancement
The steam technology available in Metrix is constantly evolving, helping its citizens with their everyday tasks, while also providing enjoyment and entertainment. From mechanical sweepers to copperwings to rocket skates, the imagination and innovation of steamtech devices never ceases to amaze.

### Mining
There are three large mining pits through the city of Metrix, surrounded by the sprawl of buildings, a black hole in the gleaming copper landscape. These pits extend deep into the earth, allowing the miners of Metrix access to the metals and minerals found deep below. Travelling down to the active mining pit at the centre of Metrix via the Gigadrill Elevator, they spend long hours drilling through layers of bedrock in search of valuable resources. Thanks to the hard work of Metrix' inventors and scientists, a number of devices now exist to help improve safety for miners, such as respirators, steamcap lamps, and dampometers.

## Tenatan Ore
An extremely rare metal ore that can only be found within the mines of Metrix. Lightweight and silver in colour, it is one of the only known natural materials that deflects arcane attacks. Since the discovery of its aether-resistant properties, scientists have been quick to begin studying the extent of its abilities, incorporating it in everything from clothing to building materials.
