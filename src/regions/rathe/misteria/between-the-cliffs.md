# Between the Cliffs

Villages and towns lie hidden amongst the mountains, close-knit communities following ancient traditions. The treacherous landscape hides these villages from outsiders, a thick blanket of mist concealing the buildings from view. Individual houses hang between the cliffs, suspended from massive networks of rope that can support the weight of entire villages. Larger communal buildings are carved into the mountainside - taverns, inns, teahouses, dojos, spaces for markets and shops, as well as places to eat, and spaces for sparring.

Every village was borne of one of the great Houses of Misteria, ancient households that can trace their lineage through the centuries. Members of the old families live in larger clusters of buildings, constructed on the highest levels of the village.

### Homes and inns
The size, scale and style of a house depends entirely on the family who resides within, and their standing within the village. Members of the main House commonly have their homes grouped together, with a small courtyard to connect the buildings. Inns, however, are much larger than the average home, connecting separate rooms with a larger common area offering somewhere to eat and socialise.

### Dojos and training grounds
Training grounds are built near the heart of a village, as the building is used by the entire community for combat practice, and to maintain their strength and agility. A dojo, however, is a place for formal training, and built in a more isolated area in order to provide a quiet, tranquil training environment.

### Teahouses
A place for people to gather after a day's work to chat, socialise, and enjoy a cup of tea. Teahouses can be found built into the rock face, suspended from a cliff overhang, or, in villages near lakes, built atop the water.

### Guard posts
These are integral to the communication between villages, serving as an early warning system for attacks and other dangers.

### The Hidden Villages
The steep mountains and jagged cliffs of Misteria make traditional construction methods impossible, so the people of Misteria have learned to build their homes in tandem with the treacherous landscape. Buildings are suspended from vines and ropes, constructed atop bamboo poles, or carved into the mountainside itself.

While villages, towns and cities elsewhere are constructed horizontally, many villages within Misteria are constructed vertically, traversing the space between the highest peaks, and the ravines below. Some buildings are even constructed on top of the water itself, only partially anchored at the sides in order to rise and fall with the water level.
