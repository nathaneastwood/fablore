# The Grandmaster's Guild

The Grandmaster's Guild is not an organisation, but a collection of individuals with mastery over their respective arts. The exact requirements and selection process are shrouded in mystery, but the Guild's legacy is well-known across Misteria, as they work to promote the Seven Arts and improve villages across the region.

### Aui's Scales
An elusive organisation of spies and assassins, known only by the symbol that they leave behind. Members of Aui's Scales are rarely seen, lurking within the mists as they watch over the people of Misteria, protecting their home from potential threats.

#### Xi, the Blind Ferryman
Those who journey to the Skylark Peaks often become lost within the mists, which grow denser as you ascend the mountain. Eventually, these lost souls arrive before a broad river, facing a broad cliff on the opposite side. Out of the mist, a small, wizened old man shall appear, his moon-white eyes almost glowing as he paddles his straw boat downstream. Those who accept his offer of help mysteriously awaken on the banks of a gentle stream, at the very top of the mountain, with little memory of how they arrived.

#### The Oracle, Valdis
A woman travels amongst the Milesian Ranges, in the space between Misteria and the land beyond. Occasionally, one may seek her out, searching for answers and the chance to gaze into their own future. Those who succeed return changed, wide-eyed, wishing that they had heeded her warning - for few who see their futures are pleased with what they find.

#### Grandmaster Zhao
At the break of dawn, as sunlight begins to stream through the thick blanket of mist, Grandmaster Zhao appears in a village to begin his day's work. Villages across Misteria claim to have been visited by this man, tall and willowy behind his pale robes, healing the ill and repairing buildings. Every village he visits soon experiences a change of fortune, as their crops flourish and people thrive. Legend speaks of the Grandmaster's secret art, mirroring the shifting waters, fluid and graceful.

## The Keepers of the Seven Arts
A guild of instructors and academics with close affiliations to the Grandmaster's Guild. Due to their strong presence and noble cause of promoting learning and progress, the Keepers are much loved and revered by Misterians. Almost all Misterian instructors are trained and stationed by the Keepers of the Seven Arts.

Occasionally, a Keeper may take on an apprentice, a young student who lives with the Keeper and studies their way of life. With time, the apprentice will be trained to take over the Keeper's position as a teacher and preserve their unique techniques and skills.
