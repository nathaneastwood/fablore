# The Primal Way

The jungle claims the weak | the feeble and slow<br>
Those who cannot endure | their end feeds the wild<br>
The wild claims the blood | the flesh and bone<br>
Feasts upon the dead | and the dying, all<br>
Where is the kindred | of the jungle deep<br>
Whose heart still beats | somewhere beyond<br>
Predator or prey | kill or be killed<br>
In fear quake all | who at death's feet lie.<br>
