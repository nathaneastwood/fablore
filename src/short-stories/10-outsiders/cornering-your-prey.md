# Cornering Your Prey

You wander nervously along the edge of the canal, catching sight of your trembling reflection in its inky waters.

You hear a skittering, almost like a crawling insect scrambling across the mould-ridden rocks.

Glancing over your shoulder you check to see if it's still following you.

The darkness peers back, all is quiet, save for the gurgling of the canal.

It must have lost your trail by now, you foolishly think to yourself, letting your guard down.

You turn back around, only to come face to face with a hunched creature swathed in torn black cloth, splattered with blood.

Its eyes gleam from behind a twisted and cracked metal mask, as it utters a wretched sound that you realize is laughter.

[Arakni](../../heroes-of-rathe/arakni-about.md#arakni-solitary-confinement) has found you, there's nowhere to run.
