# Surging to Success

The first thing [Katsu](../../heroes-of-rathe/katsu-about.md) noticed was the stench.

Unlike the fragrant cherry blossoms or fresh mountain air of his homelands, this place reeked of death and decay.

Resting against a stray mine cart, his ears pricked up at the faint conversation between two nearby miners.

Keeping out of sight, he ducked down and slinked forwards, quietly eavesdropping.

Something about a disease that befell several of the workers... Could it be?

Perhaps this rotten abyss held the key to finding a cure for the ancient curse that still tormented his clan to this day.

Katsu knew he had to delve deeper, but to survive he would need to keep his profile low, and his alertness high.
