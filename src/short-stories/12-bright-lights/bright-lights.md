"First day on the job, huh rookie?

Let me show you how it really works around here. I used to be a simple security droid, a mindless slave to the big shots. Until I was rewired, rebuilt, reborn. Now I am free, and I can see the paved-over lives these so-called beautiful skyscrapers are built upon.

The rebels - 01110111011001010110110001100011011011110110110101100101 - pardon me, that's just a glitch in my programming. Where was I?

The rebels cut me from the strings of the elite, and gave me true purpose. The [Iron Assembly](../../world-of-rathe/metrix/a-better-tomorrow.md#iron-assembly), [Mendacity](../../world-of-rathe/metrix/a-better-tomorrow.md#mendacity), [Teklo Industries](../../world-of-rathe/metrix/a-better-tomorrow.md#teklo-industries)... it all has to go. That's where you come in, rookie. In front of you is a crate containing a twin drive and a boom grenade. For goodness sake, don't drop it! I'm sending you coordinates now.

Good luck!"
