# Olympia

I have stood the test of time.

With every battle I taste blood, I adorn new scars, I win wagers.

Outside the arena, I am nothing. Inside the arena, I am everything.

I am no more a blunt tool than the Prized Fighter who wields me.

Grasping me in his seasoned hand, we cut down the weak, the slow, the meagre, as the crowd chants our name.

We are Eternal.
