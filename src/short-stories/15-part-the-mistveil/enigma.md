# Enigma

Inky ocean waters refracted slivers of evening starlight in [Enigma](../../heroes-of-rathe/enigma-about.md)'s eyes as she gazed beyond the horizon. Her mind was weighed down by heavy fog, and with each attempt to recapture a fleeting memory she mentally clutched nothing but mist-laden air.

"Who am I?" She whispered to nobody, words carried away by the gentle night breeze.

Her eyes settled on the surface of the water as circular ripples began emanating from a point she couldn't quite see clearly. A deep rumbling bubbled up from the depths as waves parted into frothing fountains of sea foam, surrounding a teething whirlpool beneath.

An impossibly long luminous serpent spiralled into the sky, washing the water's edge with its effervescent blue glow. Enigma stared at the apparition in awe as it coiled around itself, before its reptilian face bowed to meet hers. She bowed back and looked past its ghostly translucent surface, gazing deeply into the ribbons of pure spectral energy writhing and crackling within. Two gigantic eyes like full moons locked with hers inquisitively.

"Your recent reformation is perplexing you," She heard Miragai's deep voice enter her mind from seemingly all directions. "Your memories will be faint at first... and yet curiously you remembered to come here."

"I have studied the tapestry countless times," She sighed. "My ancestors do not explain what my future holds."

"The chorus of the cosmos wanes. The stars will align once more as is tradition, and yet a great imbalance threatens to revoke the harmony we have maintained for more than ten thousand years. You must traverse the universe in search of the truth to restore harmony before the next cosmic convergence." The shimmering manifestation paused. "It is a solitary journey."

Enigma frowned. "Why must I bear this burden alone?"

Miragai's snout released a puff of mist that forced her to squeeze her eyes shut. When she opened them again she was alone, save for the quiet lapping of the ocean.
