He could tell this was the right tavern from the invigorating wisps of herbal tea wafting from its doors. Curious eyes peered at him from behind a painted mask at the front desk.

"You're the one suffering from nightmares." She said softly.

He blinked at her in surprise. "How did you know?"

She beckoned him towards the hallway with a perfectly manicured finger. "We've been expecting you."

He followed her into a private spa, taking in deep lungfuls of aromatic perfume as he ventured further inside. An ornate tub lay in the centre of the room, simmering gently. Disarming candlelight flickered golden brushstrokes across the surface of the water.

"Please disrobe and enjoy the relaxing waters," She said. "Madame will be with you shortly."

His calm mind did not suspect for a moment that the door quietly sliding shut behind him had sealed his fate. He wearily shedded his clothes and belongings and climbed into the tub, feeling the hot water caress his skin. He laid back, and closed his eyes, listening to the evening breeze rhythmically toy with the window chimes. Before long he had dozed off. That's when he saw her.

A porcelain face framed by striking dark hair sent him a smile that made his knees weak. Inviting brown eyes gleamed in the darkness, granting him the attention he so desperately craved.

So enamoured was he that by the time he realised how cold the water had become, it was already too late. The air had turned sharp and acrid, and as he tried unsuccessfully to move his prone body, a pair of ruby lips appeared a tantalising mere few inches away from his. He felt his muscles atrophy, his mind numb, his very essence fade. For a brief moment he saw past the alluring face and glimpsed the monster within.

"It... was you." He managed to gasp. "All this time... The nightmares... It was you..."

He lay there horrified and helpless as reality melted around him and he sank into the dark waters below.

"You may inform our client the target has been eradicated." She ordered the girl, a sly smile snaking across her face.
