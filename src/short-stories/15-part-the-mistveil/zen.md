# Zen

The rotting wood creaked under [Zen](../../heroes-of-rathe/zen-about.md)'s feet as the weathered bridge threatened to toss him into the abyss below. His recently-established adversary, a broad-shouldered soldier clad in thick gunmetal grey armour, glared at him with his one good eye.

"Already told you," The man grunted. "I ain't moving."

"And I told you," Zen sighed. "I have no intention of turning back."

"Guess they'd call that a stalemate," Said the man, drawing a heavy sword from a sheath at his hip. "If I weren't about to cleave you in twain."

Zen tightened the grip on his Khakkara and spread his legs a little wider to account for the swaying of the bridge. The man hollered as he lunged in, swinging the blade like a log in the direction of Zen's head. Zen nimbly ducked, allowing it to whistle through empty air, then swung his staff upwards into the man's face with a satisfying crack.

His adversary growled, placing both hands around the hilt of the sword and bringing it down with the force of a falling boulder. Zen darted backwards as the blade reduced several wooden planks to splinters, then leapt onto the handrope with cat-like precision. Splaying his Khakkara horizontally for balance, he sprinted along the rope and pivoted into a flying kick that sent the man reeling backwards.

With a roar the man wiped saliva and blood from his mouth and pointed the tip of the blade towards Zen. He charged with the frenzy of a wounded bull, but only managed a few steps before the timber beneath his boots finally quit. Pale shock flooded the soldier's face as he began to plummet.

But his screams were cut short as he was suddenly yanked skyward. The man glanced up to see one of Zen's hands firmly grasping his collar, the other clasped around the Khakkara levered between the two handropes. Slowly, and with an unusual calmness, Zen hoisted the man back onto the bridge, before flipping deftly onto his feet.

"Uh... Thanks?"

"One who scatters seeds to the winds shall not know if they will ever bear fruit." Zen stated with no facial expression at all.

The man scratched his head and blinked at Zen in pure bewilderment.

"I'll um... I'll just turn back." He stammered.

Zen nodded. "Yes, that would be wise."
