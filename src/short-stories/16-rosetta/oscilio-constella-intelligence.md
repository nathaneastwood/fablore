# Oscilio, Constella Intelligence

The [Queen of Candlehold](../../regions/rathe/aria/the-land-of-legends.md) is dead, and [Aria](../../regions/rathe/aria/aria.md) has experienced a dramatic surge in [The Flow](../../regions/rathe/aria/a-true-sanctuary.md#the-flow).

This shift has awoken [Oscilio](../../heroes-of-rathe/oscilio-about.md), a wizard made by the hands and minds of the Aetherscribes. Embedded in the ancient vault of Arcturos, sealed away in the Third Age, Oscilio now finds himself navigating a strange new world.

All that Oscilio once knew is gone. He is a newcomer to the cultures and everyday concerns of greater Aria - truly the odd one out. He has no time for trivial conversation; he has a mission to complete. And thanks to the astute actions and lighthearted humor of [Aurora](../../heroes-of-rathe/aurora-about.md), Oscilio now has a guide to help him explore the lands and share his knowledge.

Unbeknownst to all, Oscilio is more than a scholar. In Oscilio, the Aetherscribes created a weapon forged to defend against forgotten evils - the wisdom contained within, a blueprint for survival.

Though Oscilio bears his creators' intellect, he is not humbled by the errors that led to their deaths. Oscilio stands at the nexus of history and prophecy, a sage who will help [Rathe](../../regions/rathe/rathe.md) prepare for the return of the malevolent entities that lie in wait.

But first, Oscilio must face his greatest challenge since his awakening. A social engagement full of sorrow and celebration, the likes of which Aria has not seen in thousands of years.
