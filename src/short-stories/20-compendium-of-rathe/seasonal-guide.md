# Seasonal Guide

Welcome, traveler. The world outside may turn and churn with the seasons, but here, in this wondrous place, ancient powers have begun to stir. You have arrived at a pivotal moment. Our scribes have called forth the echoes of the past from archives passed down through generations. Sit close by the hearth as we open the most hallowed of all our texts: the Compendium of [Rathe](../../regions/rathe/rathe.md).

Each page chronicles choices made that have shaped the ages. Tales of heroes who ventured across Rathe's lands, seas, and skies when all seemed lost. Tales of those who forged destinies through the blood and ash of war; from each, we may reflect on how far we have journeyed and what may lie ahead.

Stand strong and see it as we tell it: You, beside the Ollin on the great walls of [Isenloft](../../regions/rathe/aria/the-land-of-legends.md#isenloft), your weapon held steady against the relentless tide of the Old Ones. You, moving with silent steps along mist-veiled rope bridges, guided by the watchful moon. You, traversing the [Savage Lands](../../regions/rathe/savage-lands/savage-lands.md) to face a Gorelord armored in [skera](../../regions/rathe/savage-lands/bestiary-of-scarborough.md) hide. You, wandering through golden halls where scholars seek truth, or down shadowed corridors where forbidden knowledge waits.

This Compendium offers a passage for all into the histories of lands you may one day defend or conquer. Will you stand with [Solana](../../regions/rathe/solana/solana.md), fighting for those who dwell in the Light? Or will you follow the neon-lit monorail into [Metrix](../../regions/rathe/metrix/metrix.md), seeking to control technologies beyond mortal understanding? Whatever calling draws you, let this Compendium be your guide.

For in a single chronicle, if you play your cards right, you may find the Hero within.
