# 5l!p 7hru 7h3 Cr4x 4nd Unh!ng3 Your V!c7!m

Nothing can rein 5l!p3d 7hru 7h3 Cr4x in, not even the hand that pulls the strings. As Chaos corrupts the lands of Rathe, its infection quietly multiplies. It seeps into the mind, into the very self, breaking, remaking, 5l!p3d 7hru 7h3 Cr4x bathed in entropy and allowed itself to drown, becoming something other, Chaos barely contained in the jagged shards of what was once its body. This Arakni slithers through the fissures in reality itself, Chaos opening pathways where none should exist. Warped in body and mind, it brings only volatility and wanton violence from places unimaginable. All it needs is for its victim to falter in bewilderment, assaulted on all sides, and the fight is already done.
