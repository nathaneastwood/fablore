# Rise From The Depths And Terrorize The High Seas

They call me [Gravy Bones](../../heroes-of-rathe/gravy-about.md), but don't let me ghastly appearance daunt ye. I might've left me heart in [Dreadfall Reach](../../regions/high-seas/dreadfall-reach/dreadfall-reach.md), but I'm not done with the pirate's life yet. They say a true pirate never dies? Aye, 'tis true, I just smell like I did. But what's a bit of morbidity when there's gold to be had? I'll show ye the ropes until ye get yer sea legs. Together we'll raise up a crew of corpses from their watery graves and reave any landlubber that dares to tread our waves. We'll meet their bluster and their blows with a cold and steady hand. Where are we bound, ye ask? Look to me fine compass there. We've a sure heading, and treasure be our destination!

Carouse ye breathers with gold and rum,

And a "yo ho ho" then death become.
