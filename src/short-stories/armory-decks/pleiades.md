# Build The Arena Atmosphere Like A Superstar!

There's a special aura about you that sees the sparkle in me, and together we will touch the stars! Follow the sounds to Super Slam where I, Pleiades, and my wonderful warband, promise to keep you hooked on every note from the stage boards to the arena floor. I was once a banner woman on the battlefield, looking upwards for answers from the night sky. These fists became instruments of war that spilled blood with the bravest of them. I sang through the bloodshed and brought comfort to the wounded. These songs became anthems to inspire courage and confidence. No one can doubt that energy, that love. Not even my opponents. But at least they can embrace defeat knowing they helped this songstress give YOU a knockout performance!
