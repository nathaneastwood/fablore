# Reclaim Your Territory! Rip Your Foes Apart!

Not even [Deathmatch](../../regions/rathe/deathmatch/destination-deathmatch.md) could contain the indomitable [Rhinar](../../heroes-of-rathe/rhinar-about.md). He tore a bloody path right back into the wilds. Upon his return to the [Savage Lands](../../regions/rathe/savage-lands/savage-lands.md), the apex predator set about challenging and intimidating his way back to the top of the food chain. Now, Rhinar litters the jungle with the mangled carcasses of every creature that gets in his way. And of all the vicious beasts he bludgeons, Rhinar finds none more vile than people. Deathmatch soured his taste for their kind. He scours his territory for humans and Chanek to destroy using brutal strength, his blood-stained club, and endless bloodlust: more than enough to rid the Savage Lands of their stink.
