# Roll of Honor: Iyslander

A trail of bodies encased in ice lay behind, each a monument to her icy wrath. Before her lay the edge of the [Bleak Expanse](../../regions/rathe/aria/a-true-sanctuary.md#the-bleak-expanse), whipping and whirling, teasing and beckoning.

[Iyslander](../../heroes-of-rathe/iyslander-about.md) nursed her wounds, as the burning fury that had fuelled her rampage subsided into a cold ache. She splayed her palm and sprayed shards of ice at the ground, forming a small, crystalline pillar to lean against. The last reserves of her energy had been depleted, laying waste to the boundless forces that had tried to subdue her.

How did it come to this?

No, now was not the time for regrets. Now was the time to recover, replenish her power, embrace the cold. She would return to this place one day. Iyslander took one last longing look over her shoulder before she disappeared into the blankets of snow.
