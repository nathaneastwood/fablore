Greetings intrepid adventurer!

I recently went on an unprecedented working vacation to the Everfest Carnival as I undertook some research into the powers of The Strale and The Flow. Alas, it seems that despite the strength my Evos provide me, they could not protect me from the amber brew served up by the Braumeisters! Never the less, I had a Smashing Good Time! But yet, it seems I have misplaced 3 of my latest and greatest inventions. I just hope those pesky meeps and mireoa didn't get their teeth into them! I know I remember speaking with some strongwoman... please, I am too busy with my work, will you help me search for them? I promise it will be worth your time!

Please note - discretion is key. There are many who will be on the look out for this work, try to keep it a secret, won't you? At least for a while! - [Jules](../../heroes-of-rathe/teklovossen.md)

Thanks for all your help in finding my items, friend!

I suppose you're wondering what all the fuss is about?

Well, see for yourself! - Jules
