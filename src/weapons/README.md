## Armed to the Teeth

For centuries, the people of Rathe have known an era of peace, untouched by the ravages of war; yet, as a rising tide of unrest sweeps across the land, that peacetime is disintegrating before their very eyes. There are those who know the history of this ancient land, who quietly prepare, recognising the tides of change. Then there are those who remain unfamiliar with the fires of war, who are only just beginning to notice the flames which threaten to consume all of Rathe.

From [Aria](https://legendarystories.net/world-of-rathe/aria/aria.html) to the [Savage Lands](https://legendarystories.net/world-of-rathe/savage-lands/savage-lands.html), [Metrix](https://legendarystories.net/world-of-rathe/metrix/metrix.html) to [Misteria](https://legendarystories.net/world-of-rathe/misteria/misteria.html), heroes rise to the call, arming themselves for war. Weapons both ancient and new emerge; forges blazing, war horns echo into the night... In every corner of Rathe, its people prepare to fight.
