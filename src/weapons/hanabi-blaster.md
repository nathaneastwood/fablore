For services unto the loyal citizens of this glorious land, our Mighty [Emperor](../heroes-of-rathe/emperor-about.md), the Dracai of Aesir, bestows upon you this relic of war. May you display it boldly as a symbol of your continued devotion to the royal bloodline of [Volcor](../continents/rathe/volcor/volcor.md).

This curious contraption was a gift to his Imperial Majesty by the representatives of the Cogworks conglomerate. These far flung foreigners traveled a long ways, getting [Solana](../continents/rathe/solana/solana.md) and the [Savage Lands](../continents/rathe/savage-lands/savage-lands.md). Taking great strides to both impress and intimidate us. For while they cleverly tailored the adornments to our tastes, the invention beneath speaks of destruction, potency, the pull of a trigger, power to be yielded by the weakest peasant. By entrusting its people with such devices metrics can never again trust its people.

A formal endowment ceremony shall take place in the Imperial Palace on the eve of our esteemed Dragon Festival, where his Most Excellent Majesty shall entrust this relic to you in perpetuity.
