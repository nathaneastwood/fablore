For services unto the loyal citizens of this glorious land, our Mighty [Emperor](../heroes-of-rathe/emperor-about.md), the Dracai of Aesir, bestows upon you this relic of war. May you display it boldly as a symbol of your continued devotion to the royal bloodline of [Volcor](../regions/rathe/volcor/volcor.md).

General Koda of Sworyuk Gorge struck down a hundred men in a single day, or so the Sworyuk Song tells us. Alone, he held that narrow bridge, fighting his foes one by one, casting them into the lava below with mighty swings of his axe. With sweat and blood, he purchased the most precious commodity of all: <u>time</u>. Reinforcements arrived, led by the Emperor himself. The day was won, and though the heroic general died of his wounds, his memory lives on. Let this weapon remind us of his service and sacrifice.

A formal endowment ceremony shall take place in the Imperial Palace on the eve of our esteemed Dragon Festival, where his Most Excellent Majesty shall entrust this relic to you in perpetuity.

Dracai of Ceremonies by will of the Emperor of Volcor
