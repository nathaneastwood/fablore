For services unto the loyal citizens of this glorious land, our Mighty [Emperor](../heroes-of-rathe/emperor-about.md), the Dracai of Aesir, bestows upon you this relic of war. May you display it boldly as a symbol of your continued devotion to the royal bloodline of [Volcor](../world-of-rathe/volcor/volcor.md).

Of deplorable design and function, this primordial rock resonates with raw and primitive impulse. To Ambassador Adu, it was an abrupt and rather pulverizing lesson in diplomacy; one does not simply parley with savagery. This... object... is a gallstone in the bladder of polite society. United by the wisdom and glory of our dynasties, we have grown rather distant from our barbaric roots. Let its crude form be a reminder that one should never turn their back upon the past, for history may crush you.

A formal endowment ceremony shall take place in the Imperial Palace on the eve of our esteemed Dragon Festival, where his Most Excellent Majesty shall entrust this relic to you in perpetuity.
