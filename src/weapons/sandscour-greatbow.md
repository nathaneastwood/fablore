For services unto the loyal citizens of this glorious land, our Mighty Emperor, the Dracai of Aesir, bestows upon you this relic of war. May you display it boldly as a symbol of your continued devotion to the royal bloodline of [Volcor](https://legendarystories.net/world-of-rathe/volcor/volcor.html).

Shiftless nomads continue to resist the glories of civilization. They skulk in their dunes, jealously guard their oases, clinging like maggots to the carcass of their culture. Perhaps they are blinded by the sandstorms, or by the searing sun. Perhaps they look only into the past. This Greatbow, taken from the notorious Shaya Sandscour, serves to remind us that there is hope. Belligerence can be bested. Ignorance educated. Our fires of empire burn brightly, even in the darkest of desert nights.

A formal endowment ceremony shall take place in the Imperial Palace on the eve of our esteemed Dragon Festival, where his Most Excellent Majesty shall entrust this relic to you in perpetuity.
