# Savage Claw

This claw was ripped from the wilderness with brutal ferocity. Brutes slaughter for status as much as food, and when the carnage is done, the most prized parts are gathered: [skera](Skera) talons for grip, [brawnhide](~Brawnhide) spine for grit, [ankis](Ankis) teeth for bite. Stitched with sinew, mounted with bone, such a weapon is taken, not given. Strap this predator's trophy to your fist and make the wilds bow to your apex roar.
