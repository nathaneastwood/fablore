Beyond the walls of the golden city, past the frozen wasteland, lies a land of plenty. This ancient landscape conceals a wealth of secrets, a history which lies just beneath the surface. A tall, icy mountain holds the entrance to a sepulchre, the final resting place of a noble defender of the realm. Lying upon a stone slab, the shimmer of silversteel is unmarred by the passage of time, as brilliant as the day it was forged. Hidden beneath the stone of the mountain, the greathammer waits; for in the hands of a true hero, it might finally find a purpose once more.
