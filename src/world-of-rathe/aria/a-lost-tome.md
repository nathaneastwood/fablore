# A Lost Tome

This unnamed, damaged journal was found in a cave revealed by the changing of the Flow. It is unknown how old the journal is, or who owned it, but it remains a dubious record of someone called a "Guardian", assumedly related to Aria's history in some way. Some of the pages are missing, others show signs of water damage, and the cover is marked with what appears to be burns. We have managed to extract a small excerpt of the tome, despite the heavy damage.
