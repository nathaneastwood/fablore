# The Gateway to íArathael

After years of careful planning, some of the Demonastery's residents successfully achieved their greatest ambition, sundering the veil between this world and the next. A doorway marked in blood, activated by ancient arcane energies, now serves as the gateway to íArathael-a mirrored reality, the eternal realm of the Old Ones, where the most ancient secrets in Rathe's history slumber still.

However, any gateway to the eternal realm is innately unstable. íArathael is, by its very nature, in a state of constant transformation, and no two people who walk through the gateway will arrive in the same place. They will be transported to different corners of a mercurial reality, where even time itself is distorted. While it is easy to step through the doorway, there is no telling what one might find on the other side.
