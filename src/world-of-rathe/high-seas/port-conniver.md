# Port Conniver

What good is pirate booty without a place to squander it? What good is a grand tale of the High Seas if no one is moored long enough to marvel at it? Whether a pirate's peddling stolen goods or salty stories, the island of Port Conniver is their harbor of choice. Not so much a single place as it is a great sprawl of hideouts and hideaways, Port Conniver stretches around a craggy island in the southern parts of the High Seas.

The promenade is where pirates spend their hard-stolen gold, with taverns, gambling dens, and brothels as far as the eye can see, all settled on the sandy beach or built into the mouths of caves. Sure, it isn't as fancy as some of the swanky saloons in [Golden Port](./golden-port.md). And the streets and alleys of [Piper's Pier](./pipers-pier.md) are probably safer for walking along. But for a true pirate, one with a real thirst for adventure, there is no better place to fill your boots.

When looking to get rid of something, or someone, pirates head deeper inland. That's where they find what the landlubbers call black markets, but hark, a real pirate hasn't seen a white one. All pirates know to keep a peeper on the clientele there and, if they still have both, another on their pouch.

## Dagger Docks

The Dagger Docks of Port Conniver are where brigands, corsairs, and other sailors of a flexible moral persuasion come to sell off their goods, make repairs to their vessels, and restock the ship with foodstuff and crew.

The docks themselves are a fine mess of intersecting tunnels, hidden reservoirs, and treacherous lagoons where even frequent visitors get lost, which makes shaking off pursuers easy. Entire causeways can be barred off to repel invaders.

A Dagger Docks worker must navigate and endure some messy situations: colorful 'pets' breaking out of their crates, sea beasts drawn in by the scent of exotic meats, hostile takeovers in the dead of night, and personal grudges settled at knifepoint.

## Kraken's Barrel

They say there is no greater den of scallywags and cutthroats than the piratical patrons who frequent the Kraken's Barrel. As if that was a bad thing! These are the people a pirate wants at their side when sailing the High Seas for loot and glory. A rabble of murderous misfits, a cunning crew they can trust to be untrustworthy!

The owner of the infamous tavern runs a pretty tight ship. An alchemist in a past life, Pearl Sandhri still puts her talents for mixing things together to good use, and an even better fortune. Every so often she'll bring out a new brew for her customers to test. A wise sailor might've let their drinking mate have the first sip, but what kind of pirate waits for others?

It's bad luck to bite the hand that feeds you, and even worse to cross the lady that pours your brew. Keep the peace and you're welcome at the Kraken's Barrel; break the code, and you'll end up _in the drink_.

## Goldkiss Rum

All palates are catered to at Kraken's Barrel, but the most popular choice remains Goldkiss Rum. Bright with a rich golden flavor, even one drop seduces the staunchest of sailors, the sensation lingering like a sunbathed [siren](~Sirens)'s kiss. It's also one of the few things that can unite Port Conniver's corsairs under a single banner, a round for all buying a moment's truce.
