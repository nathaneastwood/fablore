# Immortal Lunar Temple

For the people of Misteria, the Immortal Lunar Temple is a touchstone that keeps spirit, memory, and Cosmic Chi in harmony.

By day, the temple stands as any grand monument might, offering sanctuary to traveling people and spirits alike. At the shrine of Master Kouki, petitions are left as folded notes, each seeking a solution to a haunting, a lingering grief, or dangerous vengeance. Some willing spirits come as well, drawn to a place where they can rest without being pursued, provided they do not disrupt the balance.

By night, as the moon waxes toward fullness, the temple takes on an ethereal aspect. Its wide pagoda roofs gleam with silverlight and braziers flicker in the sacred circle. Mist gathers along the temple's carvings, its shapes hinting at forgotten spirits and ancient dragons. In the twilight, the Ledger of Ancestry reads the memorial glyphs of the unseen, made legible through moon chakra.

Whoever becomes the latest incarnation of the Ledger of Ancestry guides lost and malevolent spirits back to the Cosmic Chi. They are assisted by Cosmo, a spectral scroll that records a spirit's story in ink, and guided by Master Kouki, whose instruction endures in the tenets that govern the temple.

When a Ledger of Ancestry passes, families from nearby villages come to the temple to offer their children as successors to the School of the Moon. Most lack the spiritual sensitivity, or the innate balance of chi that marks a reincarnation. Most are turned away. Those who remain train for years in the Tenets of the Moon until the one reveals their cosmic inheritance and takes up the burden of the Ledger of Ancestry.
