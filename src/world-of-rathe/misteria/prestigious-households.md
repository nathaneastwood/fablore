    <td><strong>Sanjing</strong><br>The Sanjing house is the largest clan in Mistcloak Gully, the home of their ancestors. The most famous member of the Sanjing house is Master Fang Min, who created the secret art of the Eternal Crane, a balanced combat style that combines evasive manoeuvres, and quick, sharp counterattacks.</td>

    <td><strong>Miharu</strong><br>This house creates some of the best armour in Misteria, formed from leather and toughened cloth. Flexible enough for hand-to-hand combat, yet tough enough to defend against attacks from a sharp weapon, the Miharu house provides armour for some of the largest houses in Misteria.</td>

    <td><strong>Yijun</strong><br>A house that prides themselves on their weaving, members of the Yijun house create some of the most remarkable items of clothing imaginable. Many people of Misteria purchase items for festivals and celebrations from the Yijun house. Fabric woven by members of the Yijun house can resemble anything from the shimmering ripples of a slow-moving stream, to the gentle glitter of sunlight streaming through the mists.</td>

    <td><strong>Ishigaki</strong><br>The village surrounding Mistcloak Gully exists, in part, due to the talent and skill found within the Ishigaki house. The work of stonemasons from this house is incomparable, as in carving buildings into the surrounding cliffs, they utilise the stone itself to prevent water damage and structural problems.</td>

    <td><strong>Ikaru</strong><br>The Ikaru Clan, also known as the House of Blossoms, was one of the great houses of Misteria that perished during the Night of the Dark Tide. Founded by Mistress Ikaru four hundred years prior, the Ikaru were adept at defensive martial styles, and were home to some of the best carpenters and woodworkers in all of Misteria.</td>
