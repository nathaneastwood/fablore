A ceremony for the Hand of Sol, taking place once a year. During the Solstice, older squires are promoted to full knights, while others are promoted to higher roles within the Hand of Sol. The Solstice begins with a great procession of knights, making their way from the outer walls of Solana to the Solarium, where the ceremony takes place.

It is common for Solana to receive visitors in the days leading up to the Solstice, who travel from far and wide to witness the ceremony. Whether Solanian or visitor, all marvel at the sight of noble knights marching, resplendent in ceremonial armour.
