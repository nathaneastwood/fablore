When a child of Solana turns eight years old, an archon will come to lead them to a room within the Solarium, in order to conduct the Awakening ceremony. This sacred space is filled with items, from ancient tomes to swords and shields, smithing hammers to aprons and looms; every trade and profession in Solana is represented within. Once the ceremony begins, one of the items within the room will resonate with Sol's light and begin to glow, revealing the child's divine purpose.

Many families within Solana have passed down their trades through the generation, honing their craft through Sol's divine guidance.
