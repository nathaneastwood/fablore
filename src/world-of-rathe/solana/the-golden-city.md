# The Golden City

At the centre of Rathe stands a magnificent city, towering over the golden fields that surround it. Its shining walls reflect the light of the sun, gleaming brightly, while knights clad in silver and gold patrol its borders. In the fields beyond, villages lie tucked amongst the fertile plains, safe under the watchful gaze of their great protector. This is the kingdom of Solana, a beacon of hope amongst the darkness of the world.

Those that pass through its grand gates discover an extraordinary city, built to exemplify the divine majesty of Sol. From wall to shining wall, its stone streets are lined with cheerful homes and vaulted rooftops, colourful banners swaying in the gentle breeze. At the heart of the city,
a massive series of towers rise above the streets below - the magnificent Solarium, prized jewel of Solana.

The city's elegance and symmetry are apparent to all who enter. Beyond its eight imposing gates lie eight city sectors, with eight grand walkways leading through the city to the Amphitheatre at its very core. It was built in accordance with Sol's divine will, imbued with magical wards to protect all who call it home.
