# The Royal Court

The palace of the royal court sits on the banks of Mt. Volcor, high above the conflict that plagues the rest of the region. Carved deep into the bedrock, the palace is home to the [Emperor](../../heroes-of-rathe/emperor-about.md) and the Royal Family, housing all those who live to serve them. From the court wizards to lord generals, grand strategists to consorts, the Emperor is served and protected by some of the most powerful individuals in Volcor.

### The Royal Bloodline
Many of those who reside in the palace are members of the royal bloodline, distant descendants of the first Emperor of Volcor. It is rumoured that dragon blood lies deep within their veins, giving some among them the gift of aether, and the power of the fires of Volcor.

#### The Emperor

The Emperor himself possesses the gift of aether, the most powerful wizard in all Volcor. As a direct descendant of the royal bloodline, he inherited the throne from his father, already well-versed in the politics of the court. Shrewd, resourceful and cunning, he has learned the skills necessary to stay one step ahead of his enemies, and retain his grasp on the throne.

### Court Life
Within the court is a constant struggle for power, but while the battlefields of lower Volcor are alight with the fires of war, the battles of the court are fought in hushed whispers. Factions and houses compete for the favour of the Emperor, seeking power and influence. Some houses fade into the background, entire branches of the royal bloodline lost to a streak of bad luck or a careless mistake. Falling behind means losing influence within the court, left to rot in the shadows, a powerless pawn for others to manipulate. Some die as unofficial outsiders, ostracised by the rest of the court, while others are disgraced, sent to establish their own villages and towns beyond the safety of the palace.

## Lava Flows
The [Volcai](~Volcai) are accustomed to Mt. Volcor's periodic lava flows, building their defenses in preparation for what they call the Phoenix Cycle. Sporadic and unpredictable, some places have been untouched by the lava flows for over a decade, while others suffer with every pass of the cycle. Every territory in Volcor is susceptible to becoming a victim of the lava flows, a tidal wave of magma that flows down through the rivers, creating a flood that can isolate a territory for months at a time. In some cases, it may remain unscathed. In others, an entire city can be wiped out, forcing its people to start anew amongst the ashes of their homes.
